## Mechanics Notes

Analysis and takeaways from other systems:
- `cypher_system_notes.md` — GM Intrusions, pools, what to steal
- *(Add more as you research)*

## Inspiration Images

Save images that capture the vibe you want:
- Art styles
- Character concepts
- Environmental mood
- UI/layout inspiration

---

## Raw PDFs

Store rulebooks here for reference. These are **gitignored** by default to avoid:
- Bloating the repo
- Copyright concerns

Keep them local. Reference them. Don't commit them.

## What We're Taking

### GM Intrusions ✅
The core innovation worth stealing. Compensated complications beat rules proliferation.

**How it works:**
- GM offers complication + 2 XP
- Player accepts (keeps 1, gives 1 away) or refuses (spends 1 XP)
- Natural 1s trigger free intrusions

**Why it works:**
- Handles edge cases without exhaustive rules
- Creates player buy-in for complications
- Generates social dynamic (giving XP to allies)

**Our adaptation:** IPs instead of XP. Same flow.

---

### Character Sentence ✅
"I am a [Descriptor] [Type] who [Focus]"

**Why it works:**
- Instant character concept
- Fast creation (20-30 min)
- Focus ensures party differentiation

**Our adaptation:** Focus determines Step Die progression.

---

### Single-Number NPCs ✅
NPC Level = difficulty for everything.

**Why it works:**
- Trivial prep
- Improvisation-friendly
- GM cognitive load → zero

**Our adaptation:** Keep this exactly.

---

### Degrees of Success on High Rolls ✅
17-20 provide escalating benefits.

**Why it works:**
- 25% of rolls become mechanically interesting
- Rewards without requiring crits

**Our adaptation:** Success margin (Hits above difficulty) scales effects.

---

## What We're Avoiding

### Pool = Health ❌
Might Pool serves as both action resource AND health.

**The problem:**
- Death spiral: spending makes you fragile
- Warriors become easier to kill when using their abilities
- "Stay in your lane" pressure

**Our solution:** Separate damage track. Stat pools are action resources only.

---

### ×3 Multiplication ❌
Difficulty × 3 = target number.

**The problem:**
- Cognitive overhead ("THAC0 reborn")
- Creates impossible target numbers (can't roll 11, 14)
- Confuses new players

**Our solution:** Direct Hit counting. No multiplication ever.

---

### Flat Bonuses from Skills ❌
"Trained" and "Specialized" reduce difficulty by 1 or 2.

**The problem:**
- Still feels like static modifiers
- Less tactile than adding dice

**Our solution:** Traits add dice to pool. More dice = more potential, visible in your hand.

---

## Neutral — Could Go Either Way

### Effort Spending
Spend pool points to reduce difficulty before rolling.

**Pros:**
- Creates decision points
- Resource management tension

**Cons:**
- "Wasted" points if you roll high anyway
- Drains Might = makes you fragile

**Our stance:** TBD. Might use "push" mechanics (reroll with risk) instead.

---

### Cypher Items
One-use powerful items.

**Pros:**
- Solves the "permanent power creep" problem
- Enables dramatic moments

**Cons:**
- Players hoard them
- Requires abundance + limits to work

**Our stance:** Fold this power into IP economy? Or keep as separate system?

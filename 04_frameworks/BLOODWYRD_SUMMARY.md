- Blood Oath Unfulfilled (Moderate) - Haunting unfinished oath
- Fading Sanity (Moderate) - Reality blurs
- Marked by Hela (Minor) - You've been to Helheim and back

### Your Wyrd (Fate)

Work with GM to define your destiny. Examples:

## The Nine Realms

### Midgard
Mortal world. Dark forests, frozen wastes, dying settlements.

### Helheim
Underworld. Cold, misty, ruled by Hela. Where souls go.

### Asgard
Realm of gods. Now mostly empty. Odin still watches.

### Muspelheim
Realm of fire. Fire giants sharpen blades for Ragnarök.

### Jotunheim
Land of giants. Ancient, hostile, remembering.

### Others
Alfheim (light elves), Svartalfheim (dwarves), Vanaheim (Vanir gods), Niflheim (primordial ice).

### Thin Places
Locations where realms overlap: burial mounds, standing stones, battlefields, sacred groves. Crossing is dangerous and time flows differently.

## GM Quick Principles

1. **Embrace the Grim** - World is hostile, victories are hard-won lights in darkness
2. **Psychosis as Tool** - Blur reality/supernatural, voices sometimes tell truth
3. **Wyrd is Inevitable** - Fates must come true (but not how expected)
4. **Low Magic, High Impact** - Magic is rare, dangerous, significant
5. **Honor Source Material** - Use Norse terminology, mythology, Viking history
6. **Realms are Real** - Other realms feel alien, different rules, dangerous

---

## Key Norse Terms

- **Wyrd** - Fate, destiny
- **Drengr** - Brave, honorable warrior
- **Seiðr** - Norse magic (prophecy, spirits, fate)
- **Galdr** - Rune magic, spoken spells
- **Skáld** - Poet, saga-keeper
- **Völva** - Witch, seer, oracle
- **Hamingja** - Personal luck/fate-force
- **Weregild** - Blood money to end feuds
- **Níðingr** - Oathbreaker (worst insult)
- **Ragnarök** - Twilight of gods, end of world

---

## Starting a Game

1. **Session Zero:** Establish tone (dark, grim, psychological), discuss comfort levels with horror/violence
2. **Characters:** Create using core rules + pick a Path, define Wyrd, choose starting Burden
3. **Opening Hook:** Blood oath, family feud, vision quest, journey to Helheim, or survival in dying world
4. **Remember:** This is not heroic fantasy - characters suffer, fail, and make impossible choices

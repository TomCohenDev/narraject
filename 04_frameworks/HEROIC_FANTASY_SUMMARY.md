A world of grand adventure where heroes wield magic and steel, explore ancient dungeons, battle legendary monsters, and shape the fate of kingdoms.

---

## Core Themes

## Character Creation Changes

### Optional: Fantasy Ancestry

Players may choose an ancestry that grants a minor bonus:

**Human** - Versatile (+1d6 to any one Anchor of your choice, once per session)
**Elf** - Keen Senses (+1d6 to Perception and magic-related rolls)
**Dwarf** - Resilient (+1d6 to resist poison, disease, and endurance checks)
**Halfling** - Lucky (Once per session, reroll any check and take the better result)
**Half-Orc** - Powerful (+1d6 to Might-based intimidation and raw strength)

**Note:** These are light mechanical touches. Narraject focuses on Anchors/Burdens over racial mechanics.

### Starting Gear

Choose one:
- **Warrior's Kit:** Sword or axe, shield, chainmail, adventuring pack
- **Rogue's Kit:** Daggers, leather armor, thieves' tools, rope, lockpicks
- **Mage's Kit:** Staff, spellbook, component pouch, robes, ritual materials
- **Healer's Kit:** Mace, holy symbol, light armor, healing herbs, prayer book
- **Ranger's Kit:** Bow, arrows, survival gear, animal companion (represented as Anchor)

---

## The Five Paths

*Inspired by Draw Steel's approach: Paths define your role through what you DO, not just what you ARE.*

**Path Progression:** Each Path has 5 Layers. Choose one option from each layer. You may change your choices after any Long Rest, allowing you to adapt your build to the challenges ahead.

---

### 1. Vanguard (Frontline Controller)
**Concept:** You control space and protect allies through positioning, threat, and resilience. You dictate where enemies can go and who they can threaten.

**Starting Anchors (Choose 2):**
- **Weapon Mastery: [Choose type]** (Advanced +2d6) - Your signature weapon (sword, axe, spear, hammer)
- **Battlefield Control** (Basic +1d6) - Positioning, blocking movement, forcing enemies to engage you
- **Resilient Fighter** (Basic +1d6) - Enduring hits, shrugging off pain, staying standing
- **Tactical Awareness** (Basic +1d6) - Reading the battlefield, coordinating allies, exploiting openings

---

#### Layer 1: Foundation (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Marked for Death**
- When you hit an enemy, you may mark them (no cost). While marked, they take -2d6 to attack anyone except you. You can only have one marked target at a time. Mark lasts until end of combat or you mark a different target.

**B) Guardian's Aura**
- Allies within close range of you gain +1d6 to Defense rolls. You create a zone of safety through your presence and positioning.

---

#### Layer 2: Technique (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Punishing Riposte**
- When an enemy marked by you attacks an ally (ignoring your mark), you may immediately make a free counterattack against them with +1d6.

**B) Interpose**
- When an ally within close range is attacked, you may spend 1 Focus to move next to them and become the target instead. You take the damage, but gain +1d6 to your Defense roll.

---

#### Layer 3: Mastery (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Unbreakable**
- Once per combat, when you would take a Condition, you may spend 2 Focus to ignore it entirely. You simply refuse to fall.

**B) Warlord's Command**
- Once per combat, spend 2 Focus to issue a command. All allies within hearing range immediately gain +2d6 to their next action and may move to a better position.

---

#### Layer 4: Advanced Technique (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Tide Turner**
- When you reduce an enemy to 0 (defeat them), immediately clear 2 Stress and gain +1d6 to your next action. Victory fuels you.

**B) Challenger's Shout**
- As an action, spend 1 Focus to force all enemies within close range to make a Persona check (Diff 3). Those who fail are marked by you and must focus on you.

**C) Shield Wall Formation**
- When adjacent to an ally, both of you gain +2d6 to Defense. You fight as one unit, covering each other's weaknesses.

---

#### Layer 5: Pinnacle (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Avatar of War**
- Once per session, for one full combat scene, you become an unstoppable force: +2d6 to all attacks and Defense, and you cannot be moved or knocked down against your will.

**B) Last Stand**
- When you would be taken out (reduced to 0), you may spend 3 Focus to remain standing for 3 more rounds. During this time, ignore all Conditions and penalties. After 3 rounds, you collapse.

**C) Inspiring Presence**
- Your mere presence rallies allies. At the start of each combat, all allies gain +1d6 to their first action and recover 1 Stress. When you defeat an enemy, allies within close range recover 1 additional Stress.

---

### 2. Shadow (Exploit & Maneuver)
**Concept:** You create and exploit openings. You're never where enemies expect, and you strike when they're vulnerable.

**Starting Anchors (Choose 2):**
- **Strike from Shadow** (Advanced +2d6) - Stealth, ambush, assassination, moving unseen
- **Tumbler** (Basic +1d6) - Acrobatics, dodging, climbing, escaping restraints

---

#### Layer 1: Foundation (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Exploit Vulnerability**
- When you attack a target who is engaged with an ally, unaware of you, or suffering from a Condition, gain +2d6 to the attack.

**B) Ghost Step**
- After you make any action (attack, skill check, etc.), you may immediately move to a new position without provoking attacks. You're always repositioning.

---

#### Layer 2: Technique (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Precision Strike**
- Once per round, when you hit with an attack, you may spend 1 Focus to deal +2 static damage. You know exactly where to strike.

**B) Evasive Tumble**
- When an attack would hit you, you may spend 1 Focus to make an Agility check (Diff = attacker's Level). On success, you take no damage. On failure, take half damage (round down).

---

#### Layer 3: Mastery (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Shadow Meld**
- In dim light or darkness, you gain +2d6 to Stealth checks and can hide even while being observed (as long as there's shadow nearby).

- You gain a free attack (no action needed) whenever an enemy within close range moves away from you or turns their back on you.

---

#### Layer 4: Advanced Technique (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Vanishing Act**
- Once per combat, after attacking, you may spend 2 Focus to immediately become hidden. Enemies lose track of you entirely until you attack again or reveal yourself.

**B) Calculated Risk**
- When making a risky action (GM's discretion), you may declare it beforehand. If you succeed, gain +1d6 to your next action. If you fail, your next action also gains +1d6 (your failure taught you something).

**C) Dirty Trick**
- Once per combat, instead of dealing damage with an attack, you may inflict a Minor Condition of your choice (Blinded, Disarmed, Tripped, Distracted, etc.). No damage, just the effect.

---

#### Layer 5: Pinnacle (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Death from Above**
- When you attack from an advantageous position (higher ground, surprise, ambush), you deal +3 static damage and the target must make a Persona check (Diff 4) or become Rattled (Minor Mental Condition: -1d6 to actions).

**B) Master of Escape**
- You can escape any mundane restraint (ropes, chains, grapples) automatically. For magical restraints, make an Agility check with +2d6. Once per session, you may escape a seemingly impossible situation (GM must approve, but should be generous).

**C) Strike and Fade**
- Once per session, you may attack every enemy in a scene in rapid succession (moving between them). Make one attack roll and apply it to all enemies within range. After, you may move to any position and hide.

---

### 3. Channeler (Magic Through Connection)
**Concept:** You channel power from beyond yourself - gods, ancestors, patrons, or nature. Your magic flows from relationship and devotion, not study.

**Starting Anchors (Choose 2):**
- **Channel Magic** (Advanced +2d6) - Casting spells through faith, connection, or primal bond

---

#### Layer 3: Mastery (Choose 1 of 2)

- When you heal an ally, you may transfer any of your own Stress to them (healing them) or take their Stress onto yourself (up to your Stress limit). You bear their burdens.

**B) Divine Aegis**
- Once per combat, spend 2 Focus to grant an ally a protective blessing. The next time they would take damage, they instead take no damage and the blessing ends.

---

#### Layer 4: Advanced Technique (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Mass Blessing**
- When you cast a buff spell on an ally, you may spend 1 additional Stress to affect all allies within close range instead of just one target.

**B) Turn the Unholy**
- As an action, spend 2 Focus to make a Persona check (Diff 4). All undead, fiends, or unnatural creatures within close range must make a Persona check. Those who fail must flee or cower for the rest of the scene.

**C) Martyrdom**
- When an ally within close range would be taken out (reduced to 0), you may choose to fall instead. They remain standing with 1 Stress, and you are taken out. You sacrifice yourself for them.

---

#### Layer 5: Pinnacle (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Avatar of the Divine**
- Once per session, for one full scene, you channel the full power of your source. All healing you perform is doubled, and all your spells gain +2d6 to their rolls. You glow with radiant (or primal) energy.

**B) Resurrection**
- Once per session, you may bring back an ally who was taken out within the last hour. Make a Persona check (Diff 5), pay 3 Stress, and they return to life with 1 Stress remaining. This is a miracle.

**C) Sanctuary's Circle**
- Once per session, create a zone of protection with a 10-minute ritual. Within this zone (close range from a central point), allies recover 1 Stress per hour, cannot be tracked or scried upon, and enemies cannot enter without your permission. Lasts until you leave or dismiss it.

---

### 4. Weaver (Reality Through Will)
**Concept:** You reshape reality through studied magic. You understand the fundamental laws and bend them through knowledge, preparation, and force of will.

**Starting Anchors (Choose 2):**

- **Elemental Specialization: [Choose]** (Basic +1d6) - Fire, ice, lightning, force, etc.

---

#### Layer 1: Foundation (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Efficient Casting**
- When you cast a spell that costs Stress, reduce the cost by 1 (minimum 0). Your understanding of magic makes it less taxing.

**B) Potent Magic**
- Your damaging spells deal +1 static damage. When you weave magic, it hits harder.

---

#### Layer 2: Technique (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Spell Shaping**
- When casting any spell, you may spend 1 Focus to modify it: change damage type, extend range by one increment, or affect one additional target.

**B) Counterspell**
- When an enemy casts a spell within your line of sight, you may spend 1 Focus to make an Intellect check (Diff = enemy's Level). On success, you disrupt their spell and it fails. You understand magic well enough to unravel it.

---

#### Layer 3: Mastery (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Arcane Shield**
- Once per combat, when you would take damage, you may spend 2 Focus to create an instant shield. You take no damage. The shield shatters dramatically.

**B) Overcharge**
- Once per combat, when casting a spell, you may take a Minor Mental Condition (Strained, Exhausted, etc.) to cast it at +2d6 and increase all effects by +1 (damage, healing, duration, etc.). You push beyond your limits.

---

#### Layer 4: Advanced Technique (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Battlefield Control**
- Your area-effect spells create lingering zones. After casting an area spell, that area becomes difficult terrain and enemies take -1d6 to actions while in it. Lasts until end of combat.

**B) Spell Mastery: [Choose one spell type]**
- Choose a spell type (damage, defense, utility, control). When casting that type of spell, you may reroll any dice that show 1-3 and take the better result. You've mastered this school of magic.

**C) Arcane Recovery**
- Once per Long Rest, during a Short Rest, you may recover 3 Focus by studying your spellbook or meditating on the weave of reality.

---

#### Layer 5: Pinnacle (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Signature Spell**
- Choose one spell you've cast during the campaign. That spell becomes your signature. You may cast it once per session at no cost (no Stress/Focus), and when you do, it automatically succeeds and has maximum effect. It's your masterwork.

**B) Arcane Ascension**
- Once per session, for one full combat, you ascend to a higher state. All your spells cost no Stress/Focus, you gain +2d6 to all spell rolls, and you can cast two spells per round instead of one. You become magic itself.

**C) Reality Rewrite**
- Once per session, you may declare "That didn't happen" immediately after an event occurs (an ally falls, a spell fails, an enemy escapes, etc.). Rewind time briefly and redo that moment with everyone having full knowledge of what "would have" happened. The timeline shifts. (GM has veto power for game-breaking uses.)

---

### 5. Stalker (Hunt & Exploit Terrain)
**Concept:** You excel in specific environments and hunts. You prepare, track, and strike with precision. The environment is your weapon.

**Starting Anchors (Choose 2):**
- **Precision Striker** (Advanced +2d6) - Ranged attacks (bow, crossbow, thrown), called shots
- **Master Tracker** (Advanced +2d6) - Following trails, reading signs, survival, hunting
- **Beast Bond** (Basic +1d6) - Animal companion (wolf, hawk, bear) aids you. Level 2 NPC ally.

---

#### Layer 1: Foundation (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Favored Terrain: [Choose one]**
- Choose a terrain type: Wilderness, Urban, Underground, Mountains, Desert, Arctic, Swamp, etc. While in that terrain, gain +1d6 to Stealth, Tracking, Survival, and Navigation. You are master of this environment.

**B) Prey Sense**
- You can always sense the general direction and distance of creatures you've marked or tracked within the last day. You're a hunter who never loses the trail.

---

#### Layer 2: Technique (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Hunter's Mark**
- As a free action, mark a target you can see (costs 1 Focus). Gain +1d6 to all attacks and checks against them. You instinctively know their location even if they hide. Mark lasts until they're defeated, the scene ends, or you mark a new target.

**B) Called Shot**
- When attacking, you may declare you're targeting a weak point (eye, joint, heart, etc.). Increase attack Difficulty by +1, but on success deal +2 static damage. Precision over volume.

---

#### Layer 3: Mastery (Choose 1 of 2)

**A) Camouflage Expert**
- In your favored terrain (or any natural environment), you can hide even while being observed as long as there's cover nearby. Gain +2d6 to Stealth checks in natural settings.

**B) Companion's Bond**
- Your animal companion (or a beast you've befriended) can act independently. Once per round, your companion can make an attack or provide assistance (granting you or an ally +1d6) without using your action.

---

#### Layer 4: Advanced Technique (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Multishot**
- When making a ranged attack, you may spend 2 Focus to attack two targets simultaneously. Make one attack roll and apply it to both targets. Your arrows fly with supernatural precision.

**B) Trap Master**
- You can set traps quickly (1 minute) using materials at hand. When an enemy triggers your trap, they must make an Agility check (Diff 4). Failure means they take 2 damage and become restrained or suffer a Minor Condition of your choice.

**C) Survivalist**
- In any natural environment, you can find food, water, and shelter for your group with a simple Intellect check (Diff 2). You never get lost in the wilderness. Once per session, you may produce a useful natural item you "happened to gather earlier" (rope, herbs, poison, etc.).

---

#### Layer 5: Pinnacle (Choose 1 of 3)

**A) Master Hunter**
- Once per session, when you mark a target with Hunter's Mark, that target is completely revealed to you. You know their location, their Conditions, their weaknesses, and you gain +2d6 to all actions against them. They cannot hide from you. The hunt ends when they fall.

**B) Arrow Storm**
- Once per session, you loose a devastating volley of arrows (or other ranged attacks) at all enemies in an area. Make one attack roll with +2d6 and apply it to every enemy you can see within range. The sky darkens with your projectiles.

**C) One with Nature**
- Once per session, in any natural environment, you may call upon the wild. Animals come to your aid (swarm of birds, pack of wolves, etc., treat as Level 3 allies), plants entangle your enemies (all enemies in area must make Diff 4 check or be restrained), or the terrain itself shifts to aid you (create barriers, paths, etc.). Nature itself answers your call.

## Magic System (Simplified)

### How Magic Works

**Mages** use Intellect, **Clerics** use Persona.

1. **Declare the spell/effect** you want
2. **GM sets Difficulty** based on power level:
   - **Simple** (Diff 2): Minor effects, cantrips, basic utility
   - **Moderate** (Diff 3): Standard combat spells, healing
   - **Powerful** (Diff 4): Major damage, strong buffs/debuffs
   - **Epic** (Diff 5+): Game-changing effects, legendary magic

3. **Pay the Cost BEFORE rolling:**
   - Simple: No cost or 1 Stress
   - Moderate: 1-2 Stress
   - Powerful: 2-3 Stress or 2 Focus
   - Epic: Take a Condition or major cost

4. **Roll** using Intellect (Mage) or Persona (Cleric) + Arcane/Divine Magic Anchor
5. **On Success:** Spell happens as intended
6. **On Failure:** Spell fizzles, cost already paid (magic is risky!)

### Common Spell Effects

**Damage Spells:**
- Standard damage: Diff 3, 1 Stress, deals (Successes - Difficulty) damage to target
- Area damage: Diff 4, 2 Stress, deals static 2-3 damage to all in area

**Healing:**
- Restore Stress: Diff 2, 1 Stress, restore 2 Stress to target
- Remove Condition: Diff 3, 2 Stress, remove Minor Condition (Diff 4 for Moderate)

**Buffs/Debuffs:**
- Grant ally +1d6 for scene: Diff 3, 1 Stress
- Enemy takes -1d6 for scene: Diff 3, 2 Stress

**Utility:**
- Light, detect magic, minor illusions: Diff 1-2, no cost
- Teleportation, scrying, powerful divination: Diff 4-5, 2-3 Stress

## GM Quick Principles

1. **Embrace the Adventure** - This is heroic fantasy. Let heroes be heroic. Big moments, epic fights, dramatic victories.
2. **Magic is Common** - Spellcasters are powerful and useful. Let magic solve problems creatively.
3. **Classic Tropes** - Use familiar fantasy elements (taverns, dungeons, dragons, treasure). Players know and love these.
4. **Clear Stakes** - Make threats obvious. The dark lord, the ancient evil, the dragon's hoard. Players should know what they're fighting for.
5. **Dungeons & Exploration** - Encourage exploration, trap-finding, puzzle-solving. Reward clever thinking.
6. **Progression Feels Good** - Characters should feel powerful as they level. Give them legendary magic items, epic foes, and world-shaping quests.

---

## Starting a Game

1. **Session Zero:** Establish the campaign tone (classic adventure? dark and gritty? comedic?), discuss character party balance
2. **Hook:** Start in a tavern, or with a quest from a noble, or en route to a dungeon. Keep it classic or subvert expectations.
3. **First Session:** Give immediate adventure - a nearby threat, a dungeon to explore, bandits to fight. Let them feel heroic early.
4. **Build the World:** Introduce kingdoms, factions, gods, legends. But start local - save the world-threatening plot for later.

---

## Quick Reference

### Success Counting
- **4, 5, or 6 on d6 = 1 Success** (50% per die)
- Compare total Successes to Difficulty

### Difficulty Scale
- 1 = Easy | 2 = Moderate | 3 = Challenging | 4 = Hard
- 5-6 = Very Hard | 7-8 = Heroic | 9-10 = Legendary | 10+ = Mythic

### Building Your Pool
**Add Dice:** Rating + Anchors + Gear + Magic/Buffs
**Remove Dice:** Burdens + Conditions + Debuffs
**Add Successes After Rolling:** Focus (1 Focus = +1 Success, max = Stat Rating)

### Damage
**Damage = Difficulty - Your Successes**
Fills Stress Track (3 points), then causes Conditions

### Magic Costs
- Simple (Diff 1-2): Free or 1 Stress
- Moderate (Diff 3): 1-2 Stress
- Powerful (Diff 4): 2-3 Stress or 2 Focus
- Epic (Diff 5+): Take Condition or major sacrifice

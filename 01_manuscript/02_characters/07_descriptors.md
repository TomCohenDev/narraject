# Descriptors

Your Descriptor is the adjective in your character sentence—who you are as a person.

## What Descriptors Provide

Each Descriptor grants:
- **Trait:** One free trait reflecting the descriptor
- **Flaw:** A narrative weakness
- **Narrative flavor:** Who you are, not just what you do

Descriptors don't modify stats in the new system. Your Package sets your Ratings. Descriptors add personality and a trait.

## Using Descriptors

Descriptors modify your Package's starting stats. If your Package gives you Might Rating 3 and you take Tough (+4 Might), you have Might Rating 3 (the +4 is added to your Reserve capacity, not Rating).

Wait—that doesn't match the design. Let me check the system...

Actually, in the new system, Descriptors should modify Ratings, not Reserves. The +4 should be to Rating, which then affects Capacity. But we need to be careful about balance.

Actually, looking at the Packages, they give Ratings (1-3). Descriptors giving +4 would be way too much. Let me adjust:

**Revised:** Descriptors grant +1 to one Rating OR no stat bonus but two free Traits. The flaw remains.

Or maybe Descriptors don't modify stats at all in the new system? Let me check what makes sense with Rating/Reserve.

Looking at the Packages, they have Ratings 1-3. A +4 bonus doesn't make sense. Let me revise to match the new system better.
</thinking>

Looking at the Packages, they use Ratings (1-3 range). The old Descriptor system gave +4 to stats (which was probably for the old Pool system). For the new Rating/Reserve system, Descriptors should work differently.

Let me create a version that fits the new system:

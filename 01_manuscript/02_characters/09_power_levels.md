# Power Levels and Point Buy

While **Packages** provide balanced starting characters, you may want to create characters at different power levels—seasoned veterans, legendary heroes, or street-level newcomers.

This section provides **point buy guidelines** based on what difficulty tier should be "fairly easy" (~70-80% success) when characters optimize their pools with Rating + Effort + Traits + Gear.

---

## Understanding the Math

When you roll, you're looking for **Successes** (5-6 on d6). Each die has a **33% chance** of showing a Success.

More dice = more consistent results. But how many dice do you need for different difficulties?

**Key Insight:** A 3d6 baseline gives you ~70% for 1 Success (Easy tasks). For harder tasks, you need optimization.

## Point Buy by Power Level

| Level  | "Fairly Easy" Difficulty | Stat Points | Example Distribution   | Expected Traits          |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **1**  | Easy (1 mark)            | **4-6**     | (2,1,1,0) or (1,1,1,1) | 0-1 basic                |
| **2**  | Moderate (2 marks)       | **8-12**    | (3,3,2,0) or (3,2,2,1) | 2-3 basic                |
| **3**  | Challenging (3 marks)    | **12-16**   | (4,4,3,1) or (5,3,3,1) | 3-4 (1-2 adv)            |
| **4**  | Hard (4 marks)           | **16-20**   | (5,5,4,2) or (6,5,4,1) | 4-5 (2-3 adv)            |
| **5**  | Very Hard (5 marks)      | **20-24**   | (6,6,5,3) or (7,6,5,2) | 5+ (2-3 adv, 1 master)   |
| **6**  | Formidable (6 marks)     | **24-28**   | (7,7,6,4) or (8,7,6,3) | 6+ (3-4 adv, 1-2 master) |
| **7+** | Heroic/Legendary         | **28-32**   | (8,8,7,5) or (9,8,7,6) | Full optimization        |
|        |                          |             |                        |                          |

**Note:** Standard Packages (The Muscle, The Face, The Tech, The Scout) each have **7 total stat points**, placing them between Level 1 and Level 2.

## Extended Stat Ratings

Ratings can go up to **10** for truly lei gendary characters:

| Rating | Reserve Capacity | Effort Cap | Max Single Pool (Rating + Effort + ~6 from traits/gear) |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | 7                | 3          | ~10d6                                                   |
| 2      | 9                | 4          | ~12d6                                                   |
| 3      | 11               | 5          | ~14d6                                                   |
| 4      | 13               | 6          | ~16d6                                                   |
| 5      | 15               | 7          | ~18d6                                                   |
| 6      | 20               | 9          | ~21d6                                                   |
| 7      | 23               | 10         | ~23d6                                                   |
| 8      | 26               | 11         | ~25d6                                                   |
| 9      | 29               | 12         | ~27d6                                                   |
| 10     | 32               | 13         | ~29d6                                                   |
|        |                  |            |                                                         |

**Formulas:**

- **Rating 1-5:** Reserve = (Rating × 2) + 5
- **Rating 6-10:** Reserve = (Rating × 3) + 2
- **Effort:** Effort = Rating + 2

This accelerated growth ensures legendary characters can consistently achieve heroic feats while preventing single-roll nova builds that empty their entire Reserve.

## Campaign Recommendations

### Street Level (Level 1)

**4-6 stat points**

Use for: Civilians learning the ropes, inexperienced rookies, desperate survivors.

**Example:** (2,1,1,0) — A scrappy fighter with no social graces.

---

### Competent Protagonist (Level 2)

**8-12 stat points**

Use for: Standard starting characters, trained professionals, main campaign protagonists.

**Standard Packages fall here** — 7 points gives balanced competency.

**Example:** (3,3,2,0) — Combat specialist with decent awareness.

---

### Veteran Expert (Level 3)

**12-16 stat points**

Use for: Experienced operatives, mid-campaign characters, dangerous adversaries.

**Example:** (5,4,3,0) — Elite soldier specializing in combat.

---

### Master Specialist (Level 4-5)

**16-24 stat points**

Use for: Campaign endgame, legendary NPCs, epic-tier threats.

**Example:** (7,6,5,2) — World-class operative who can handle Very Hard tasks.

---

### Legendary Hero (Level 6+)

**24+ stat points**

Use for: Gods, ancient dragons, civilization-ending threats, mythic finales.

**Example:** (9,8,7,6) — Can attempt Heroic tasks with reasonable odds.

---

## Working Example: Level 2 Character (8 points)

**Concept:** Combat Medic
**Stats:**
- Might 3 (Reserve: 11, Effort: 5)
- Agility 3 (Reserve: 11, Effort: 5)
- Intellect 2 (Reserve: 9, Effort: 4)
- Persona 0 (Reserve: 5, Effort: 2)
**Traits:** Combat Trained (Advanced +2d6), Field Medicine (Basic +1d6)
**Gear:** Assault Rifle (+1d6), Med Kit

### The Math in Action

**Treating a wounded ally under fire (2 marks = Moderate difficulty):**

- Base: 2 (Intellect)
- Effort: +2 (spend 2 Reserve, within Effort cap of 4)
- Trait: +1d6 (Field Medicine)
- **Total: 5d6** = 53.9% chance of 2+ marks
- **Reserve Remaining:** Intellect 7/9

**Returning fire while treating them (2 marks = Moderate difficulty):**

- Base: 3 (Agility)
- Effort: +3 (spend 3 Reserve, within Effort cap of 5)
- Trait: +2d6 (Combat Trained)
- Gear: +1d6 (Assault Rifle)
- **Total: 9d6** = 85.7% chance of 2+ marks (fairly easy)
- **Reserve Remaining:** Agility 8/11

This character handles Moderate tasks fairly easily in their specialty (combat), struggles with Challenging tasks (3 marks = 60.5% at 9d6), and Very Hard tasks (5+ marks) are aspirational goals requiring perfect optimization and luck.

**Resource Management:** With Effort caps, this character can't dump all their Reserve into one nova roll. They must pace themselves across multiple actions in a scene.

---

## Design Principles

### Optimization Gap

Characters with Rating 5 can build pools of 5 (rating) + 7 (effort cap) + 4 (traits) + 2 (gear) = **18d6** per roll.

Characters with Rating 10 can build pools of 10 (rating) + 13 (effort cap) + 6 (traits) + 2 (gear) = **31d6** per roll.

**System mastery matters.** Smart choices about when to spend Reserve, which Traits to activate, and what Gear to carry make the difference. Legendary characters (Rating 10) can consistently achieve Heroic tasks (7-8 marks) and have a fighting chance at Legendary tasks (9-10 marks).

**Effort vs. Reserve:** While Rating 10 characters have 32 Reserve, they can only spend 13 per roll (Effort cap). This means they can sustain 2-3 maximum-effort rolls per scene before needing rest, creating natural pacing and tension.

### Specialization vs. Generalization

At any point buy level, you can specialize or generalize:

- **Specialist:** (8,2,2,0) = 12 points, amazing at one thing
- **Generalist:** (4,3,3,2) = 12 points, decent at everything

Both are viable. Choose based on your concept.

### Aspiration Design

A Level 2 character (8 points) **CAN** attempt a Hard task (4 marks). They just have ~13% chance even fully optimized.

**That's fine.** It creates memorable moments when they succeed, and acknowledges that heroes sometimes attempt the impossible.

### Progression Over Time

Characters advance by:

1. **Increasing Ratings** (spend advancement points)
2. **Acquiring better Traits** (upgrade Basic → Advanced → Master)
3. **Finding better Gear** (quality weapons, rare items)
4. **Unlocking Injections** (unique abilities with Injector Dice)

A Level 2 character who advances to Level 4 doesn't just add +8 stat points. They also gain Advanced Traits, better equipment, and new Injections. The combined effect makes Hard tasks (4 marks) feel "fairly easy."

## GM Guidance: Setting Difficulties

Use this table when deciding how many Successes a task requires:

| Successes | Difficulty      | When to Use                                           |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**     | **Easy**        | Level 1-2 characters should handle this ~70% of time  |
| **2**     | **Moderate**    | Level 2-3 characters should handle this fairly easily |
| **3**     | **Challenging** | Level 3-4 characters need to optimize                 |
| **4**     | **Hard**        | Level 4-5 characters can achieve with good builds     |
| **5**     | **Very Hard**   | Level 5-6 characters at full power                    |
| **6**     | **Formidable**  | Even legendary builds struggle (20-30% odds)          |
| **7-8**   | **Heroic**      | Requires 20+ dice and luck                            |
| **9-10**  | **Legendary**   | Even optimized legendary characters need fortune      |

**Golden Rule:** Success = Intent Happens. More marks = more narrative control, not "you barely succeeded."

## Custom Point Buy

Want to build outside Packages? Use point buy:

1. **Determine campaign power level** (use table above)
2. **Allocate stat points** freely (1 point = 1 Rating)
3. **Calculate Reserve capacity** (Rating × 2 + 5)
4. **Select Traits** based on level (see table)
5. **Work with GM** to define starting gear
6. **Create 1-2 Injections** collaboratively

**Balance is optional.** If everyone agrees, (10,0,0,0) is valid. It creates interesting constraints.

---

## Using Point Buy for NPCs

When creating important NPCs, use point buy to match the party's power level or exceed it:

- **Rival operative:** Same point total as party
- **Seasoned antagonist:** +4 to +8 points above party
- **Campaign villain:** +8 to +12 points, plus narrative advantages
- **Ancient dragon:** 32+ points, reality-warping abilities

**Remember:** NPCs don't need full character sheets. Assign a point total, give them 2-3 signature Traits, and improvise the rest.

---

## Probability Reference

For GMs who want exact odds, reference the **Roll Odds** probability table in the character sheet or use this quick guide:

**Rough Benchmarks (70-80% success):**

- 1 mark = 3-4d6
- 2 marks = 7-8d6
- 3 marks = 10-11d6
- 4 marks = 14-15d6
- 5 marks = 17-18d6
- 6 marks = 20-22d6
- 7+ marks = 25+ dice (and prayer)

These are **optimized pools** (Rating + effort + traits + gear + situation). Base Rating alone won't hit these numbers—characters need to invest resources.

---

## Final Thoughts

**Don't overthink it.** Standard Packages work great for most games. Use point buy when you need specific power levels, veteran characters, or custom concepts.

The system rewards smart play, resource management, and creative problem-solving. A Level 2 character with clever tactics can punch above their weight. A Level 5 character who wastes their Reserve will struggle with Moderate tasks.

**Play to find out what happens.**

# Flaws

Flaws are narrative weaknesses, fears, or physical limitations that mechanically hinder your character.

---

## The Rule of Balance

**You must have 1 Flaw for every 1 Trait you possess.**

This ensures characters have both strengths and weaknesses. If you have 4 Traits, you must have 4 Flaws. If you gain a new Trait, you must also gain a new Flaw.

## How Flaws Work

When a Flaw applies to a situation, it removes dice from your pool or introduces a fail-state condition.

### Dice Removal

Most Flaws remove dice from your pool when they apply:

- **Minor Flaw:** -1d6
- **Moderate Flaw:** -2d6
- **Severe Flaw:** -3d6

### Fail-State Conditions

Some Flaws introduce conditions that cause automatic failure or complications:

- **Phobia:** If you're in your phobia situation, you must spend IP or accept a complication to proceed.
- **Compulsion:** You must take certain actions or accept a penalty.
- **Physical Limitation:** Certain actions are impossible or require additional resources.

Work with your GM to determine how your Flaws manifest mechanically.

## When Flaws Apply

A Flaw applies when:
- The situation directly triggers your weakness
- Your fear or limitation would realistically hinder you
- The GM determines it's relevant to the action

**Example:** If you have the Flaw "Claustrophobic" and you're trying to squeeze through a narrow passage, the Flaw applies. You might lose -2d6 from your Agility pool for that action.

## Earning IP from Flaws

If a Flaw significantly hinders the party or causes a failure, the GM may award you **1 IP** for playing your Flaw honestly.

This rewards roleplay and makes Flaws feel meaningful rather than purely punitive.

## Sample Flaws

### Minor Flaws (-1d6)

- **Easily Distracted:** -1d6 on concentration checks
- **Blunt:** -1d6 on social subtlety
- **Hesitant:** -1d6 on initiative or quick decisions
- **Gullible:** -1d6 on detecting deception

### Moderate Flaws (-2d6)

- **Nightmares:** -2d6 when sleep-deprived or in darkness
- **Overconfident:** -2d6 when rushing or taking shortcuts
- **Impatient:** -2d6 on tasks requiring careful, slow work
- **Haunted:** -2d6 in supernatural or traumatic situations

### Severe Flaws (-3d6)

- **Phobia:** -3d6 (or fail-state) when in phobia situation
- **Addiction:** -3d6 (or fail-state) when craving is active
- **Physical Disability:** -3d6 (or impossibility) for certain actions
- **Cursed:** -3d6 (or fail-state) when curse is active

## Creating New Flaws

When creating new Flaws:

1. **Make it narrative first.** What is the weakness? Why does it exist?
2. **Determine severity.** How much does it hinder? (Minor/Moderate/Severe)
3. **Define triggers.** When does it apply?
4. **Consider mechanical effect.** Dice removal, fail-state, or both?

Work with your GM to ensure Flaws are meaningful but not debilitating.

## Flaws and Progression

As you gain new Traits, you must also gain new Flaws. This maintains the Rule of Balance.

You cannot remove Flaws through progression—they're part of who you are. However, you might work to overcome specific Flaws through roleplay, which could reduce their severity or change their nature (with GM approval).

## Quick Reference

| Flaw Severity | Dice Penalty | Notes                          |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Minor**     | -1d6         | Nuisance, but manageable      |
| **Moderate**  | -2d6         | Significant hindrance          |
| **Severe**    | -3d6         | Major obstacle or fail-state   |

Remember: Flaws make characters interesting. They create drama, require creative problem-solving, and earn IPs when they matter.

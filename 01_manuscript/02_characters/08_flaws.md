# Flaws

Flaws are vulnerabilities you create for your character—narrative hooks, complications, and weaknesses that the GM can use to make the story personal.

**Think of them as knives:** You lovingly forge them and hand them to the GM so the GM can stab you with them over and over again.

That sounds terrible. It's actually brilliant.

## Why Flaws Matter

In a game where success means your intent happens (period), Flaws are what create tension. They're moments when the dice aren't enough. When your past catches up. When your fears manifest. When the universe reminds you that you're not invincible.

**Mechanically,** Flaws remove dice from your pool when they apply.

**Narratively,** Flaws give the GM ammunition to make your character's story _matte and interesting_. They transform generic encounters into personal stakes. They create drama. They make you vulnerable.

And when you play your Flaws honestly—when you let them complicate your life—you earn **Injector Points** for it.

---

## The Rule of Balance

**You must have 1 Flaw for every 1 Trait you possess.**

This ensures characters have both strengths and weaknesses. If you have 4 Traits, you must have 4 Flaws. If you gain a new Trait, you must also gain a new Flaw OR develop a flaw to higher stakes.

Flaws are a mix of mechanical penalties and narrative complications that the GM can pull from to make every session feel personal.

## Types of Flaws: Building Your Knife Block

When creating your character, aim for **variety** in your Flaws. Mix mechanical penalties with narrative hooks. Give the GM different tools to work with.

Here are categories to consider:

### 1. People You Care About
**Living or dead.** Named NPCs the GM can threaten, manipulate, or bring back into your life.

- Your sibling who thinks you're dead
- The mentor you betrayed
- The spouse you left behind
- The childhood friend who became your rival
- The parent who disowned you

**Mechanical Effect:** Minor to Moderate penalty when they're threatened or present.

### 2. Phobias and Trauma
**Things that make you freeze, panic, or lose control.**

- Claustrophobia (tight spaces)
- Pyrophobia (fire)
- Heights
- Crowds
- Darkness
- Specific enemy types (e.g., undead, machines)

**Mechanical Effect:** Moderate to Severe penalty in trigger situations, or fail-state requiring IP spend.

### 3. Mysteries in Your Past
**Unanswered questions that haunt you.**

- Unknown parents
- Unexplained powers
- Missing time
- A prophecy about you
- The reason you survived when others didn't

**Mechanical Effect:** Usually narrative only, but can impose penalties when the mystery is directly relevant.

### 4. Enemies and Rivals
**Named antagonists who want you dead, captured, or broken.**

- The crime boss you testified against
- The rival who blames you for their downfall
- The organization hunting you
- The ex-partner who swore revenge

**Mechanical Effect:** Minor penalty when they're near, or narrative complications when they appear.

### 5. Obligations and Loyalties
**Debts, oaths, or commitments that constrain you.**

- You owe someone a favor
- You're sworn to protect someone
- You must follow a code
- You're bound to an organization
- You promised to never use violence

**Mechanical Effect:** Penalties when violating the obligation, or complications when it conflicts with the mission.

### 6. Failed Obligations
**Promises you broke. Duties you abandoned.**

- The mission you failed
- The person you couldn't save
- The oath you violated
- The team you left behind

**Mechanical Effect:** Moderate penalty in situations that remind you of the failure.

### 7. Crimes and Secrets
**Things you've done. Things you're hiding.**

- A murder (justified or not)
- Desertion
- Theft of something important
- Betrayal of trust
- False accusations you're avoiding

**Mechanical Effect:** Severe penalty if exposed, or narrative complications when secrecy is threatened.

### 8. Discrimination Experienced
**Prejudice, marginalization, or systemic barriers.**

- Fantasy racism (elf/dwarf/orc)
- Social class barriers
- Religious persecution
- Outlawed profession
- Visible augmentation stigma

**Mechanical Effect:** Minor to Moderate penalty in hostile social situations.

### 9. Prized Possessions
**Items you'll risk everything to protect or recover.**

- Family heirloom
- Magical artifact
- Last gift from a dead loved one
- Proof of your innocence
- Your ship/vehicle/home

**Mechanical Effect:** Minor penalty when separated from it, or narrative hooks when it's threatened.

### 10. Physical Limitations
**Disabilities, injuries, or conditions that hinder you.**

- Missing limb
- Chronic pain
- Poor vision/hearing
- Respiratory condition
- Addiction

**Mechanical Effect:** Moderate to Severe penalty on relevant actions, or fail-states for certain tasks.

### 11. Personality Flaws
**Character traits that get you in trouble.**

- Overconfident
- Cowardly
- Compulsive liar
- Greedy
- Impulsive
- Arrogant

**Mechanical Effect:** Minor to Moderate penalty when the trait leads you into poor decisions.

## Forging Your Flaws: Collaboration with the GM

**Before the game starts**, sit down with your GM and discuss your Flaws. This isn't just a mechanical exercise—you're handing the GM narrative ammunition.

Ask these questions together:

1. **Which Flaws are mechanical?** (Dice penalties) Which are purely narrative hooks?
2. **How severe is each Flaw?** Minor, Moderate, or Severe?
3. **When do they apply?** Define clear triggers.
4. **Can the GM introduce these Flaws without warning?** Or should they telegraph them first?
5. **Are any Flaws off-limits?** (Topics you don't want explored in-game)

**Example Conversation:**

> **Player:** "I have a Flaw: my sister Kara thinks I'm dead. She's a corporate exec now."
> **GM:** "Perfect. So if she shows up, what happens?"
> **Player:** "Minor penalty to social rolls when she's present—I'm distracted."

**That's a good knife.** Sharp, specific, and ready to stab.

## How the GM Uses Your Flaws

The GM has permission to stab you with your knives **at any time**. That's the deal. But good GMs use them thoughtfully:

### Mechanical Application
When a Flaw applies to a situation, it removes dice from your pool:

- **Minor Flaw:** -1d6 (nuisance)
- **Moderate Flaw:** -2d6 (significant hindrance)
- **Severe Flaw:** -3d6 (major obstacle)

**Example:** You have "Claustrophobic (Moderate)" and you're crawling through a ventilation shaft. The GM says: "You're losing -2d6 from your Agility pool. Your hands are shaking."

### Narrative Application
The GM can also use Flaws to introduce complications, raise stakes, or create dramatic moments:

- Your enemy from the backstory shows up at the worst time
- Your secret is about to be exposed
- Your loved one is in danger
- Your phobia triggers in a critical moment
- Your obligation conflicts with the mission

**Example:** You have "Sister (Kara) thinks I'm dead." The GM says: "As you enter the corporate lobby, you see her. She's walking toward you. She hasn't seen you yet. What do you do?"

### The Stab-and-Reward Cycle
When a Flaw **meaningfully complicates your life**—causes a failure, forces a difficult choice, or creates dramatic tension—the GM can and should award you **1 IP** if the flaw plays out well and creates a good story.

This creates a beautiful loop:
1. GM stabs you with your Flaw
2. You play it honestly (take the penalty, roleplay the complication)
3. GM rewards you with IP
4. You spend IP later to be awesome

**Flaws make you vulnerable. IPs make you powerful. The cycle continues.**

### When NOT to Award IP (Boring Stab)

**Example:** You have "Claustrophobic (Moderate)" and you're crawling through a dungeon corridor.

**GM:** "The walls are tight here. Take -2d6 to your Agility pool."
**Player:** *Rolls with the penalty, succeeds, moves on*

**No IP awarded.** Why? The Flaw applied mechanically, but it didn't create drama. It was just a tax on the dice pool. The player didn't make a difficult choice, experience narrative tension, or create a memorable moment. It was routine.

**This is fine.** Not every Flaw trigger needs to be epic. But routine penalties don't earn IPs.

### When to Award IP (Good Stab)

**Same Flaw, Same Corridor. Different Choices.**

**GM:** "The walls are closing in. The corridor narrows to barely shoulder-width. You hear voices behind you—the guards are coming. You need to crawl through fast."

**Player:** *Panics* "No. No, I can't. My chest is tightening. I'm starting to hyperventilate."

**GM:** "The voices are getting closer. Your party is ahead—they're through the narrow section, waving you forward. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I... I try to push forward, but I'm shaking. Can I still make the Agility roll?"

**GM:** "Yes, but you're at -2d6 from the claustrophobia. And the guards will spot you in seconds if you don't move NOW."

**Player:** *Rolls, fails* "I freeze. I can't move. I'm stuck."

**GM:** "Your teammate reaches back: 'Grab my hand! NOW!' The guards round the corner. They see you."

**Player:** "I grab their hand. I let them pull me, even though every instinct is screaming to back out. I'm crying, I'm terrified, but I trust them."

**GM:** "You're dragged through, gasping. The guards open fire just as you clear the gap. Your party slams a door shut. You're safe—but you're a wreck."

**Award 1 IP.** Why? Same Flaw, same mechanical penalty—but this time:
1. **The player roleplayed the panic honestly** (hyperventilating, freezing, crying)
2. **The failure created dramatic tension** (guards spotted them, party had to intervene)
3. **A difficult choice emerged** (trust the teammate vs. flee back)
4. **Character relationships deepened** (vulnerability shown, trust built)
5. **The moment mattered** (everyone at the table felt it)

The difference isn't the Flaw. It's **how the player and GM engaged with it**. One was mechanical. The other was a knife to the heart.


**Example:** You have "Sister (Kara) thinks I'm dead" and you're infiltrating a corporate gala to steal data.

**GM:** "As you're hacking the terminal, you hear a familiar laugh. You turn—and there's Kara, twenty feet away, talking to a group of executives. She's walking this direction. She hasn't seen you yet."

**Player:** *Freezes* "Oh no. Can I... can I hide my face without blowing my cover?"

**GM:** "You'd need to turn away from the terminal mid-hack. The download has 30 seconds left. If you turn away, you might lose the data. If you stay focused, she might see you."

**Player:** *Agonizes, decides to stay focused, takes -2d6 to the hacking roll from distraction, barely succeeds* "I'm keeping my head down, but my hands are shaking. Please don't let her see me..."

**GM:** "The download finishes. You pull the drive. And then you hear: 'Excuse me, do I know you?' She's right behind you."

**Award 1 IP.** Why? The Flaw created:
1. **A difficult choice** (mission vs. secrecy)
2. **Dramatic tension** (real stakes, real fear)
3. **A memorable moment** (the player agonized, roleplayed honestly, and now faces consequences)

The Flaw didn't just impose a penalty—it stabbed deep. The player bled beautifully. That earns IP.

## When Flaws Apply

A Flaw applies when:
- The situation directly triggers your weakness
- Your fear or limitation would realistically hinder you
- The narrative benefit outweighs the mechanical penalty

**The GM decides, but players can invoke their own Flaws** to earn IP. If you see an opportunity to make your life harder for narrative drama, ask: "Does my Flaw apply here?"

Good GMs will say yes and hand you an IP.

---

## Variety Matters

Don't make all your Flaws the same type. A character with 7 phobias is one-note. A character with:
- A sister who thinks they're dead
- Claustrophobia
- A rival who swore revenge
- Overconfidence
- A secret murder
- Loyalty to a shady organization
- A prized family heirloom

**That's a rich character.** The GM has options. Some Flaws are mechanical. Some are narrative. Some are both. Mix it up.

---

## Bundling Flaws (Advanced)

GMs can combine multiple characters' Flaws into one giant knife:

**Example:**
- Character A has Flaw: "Sister Kara (corporate exec)"
- Character B has Flaw: "Rival named Marcus (wants revenge)"
- GM's twist: Kara and Marcus are dating

**Suddenly two knives become one massive blade.** Both characters are stabbed simultaneously. Drama ensues. IPs are earned.

This is advanced GMing, but when it works, it's magical.

---

## Flaws and Progression

As you gain new Traits through advancement, you must also gain new Flaws. The Rule of Balance persists.

You **cannot remove Flaws** through mechanical progression—they're part of your story. However, you can work to **overcome them narratively**:

- Therapy for trauma
- Reconciliation with estranged loved ones
- Defeating your rival
- Solving the mystery
- Paying your debts

With GM approval, resolved Flaws might:
- Reduce in severity (Severe → Moderate)
- Change nature (enemy becomes uneasy ally)
- Become narrative victories (the heirloom is recovered)

If a flaw is removed the GMs might reward the player with more IP point depending on the narrative.

## For GMs: How to Stab Effectively

**Use Flaws to**:
1. **Personalize generic encounters.** The random guard? He's your character's old squadmate.
2. **Raise stakes.** The bomb isn't in a warehouse—it's in your sister's apartment.
3. **Create difficult choices.** Save the mission or save your loved one?
4. **Generate IPs.** When you stab, reward the player for bleeding.

**Don't**:
1. **Stab too often.** A Flaw used every scene loses impact.
2. **Stab without variety.** Rotate through different characters' Flaws.
3. **Forget to reward.** Meaningful complications deserve IPs.
4. **Cross boundaries.** Honor off-limits topics discussed in Session Zero.
5. **Stop successful plans.** Let the players have their hard earn wins.

**The players gave you these knives because they trust you to use them well.**

## Quick Reference

| Flaw Severity | Dice Penalty | When to Use |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Minor**     | -1d6         | Nuisance that complicates but doesn't cripple |
| **Moderate**  | -2d6         | Significant hindrance requiring adaptation |
| **Severe**    | -3d6         | Major obstacle or fail-state condition |

**IP reward:** 1 IP when a Flaw meaningfully complicates the story

---

## Final Thought

Flaws aren't weaknesses to hide. They're invitations to drama. They're promises that your character's story will matter—that the GM won't just throw generic obstacles at you, but will craft complications that cut deep.

**Forge your knives with care. Hand them to your GM with trust. Then enjoy the beautiful, bloody story that follows.**

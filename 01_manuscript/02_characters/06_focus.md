# Focus

Your Focus is the verb phrase in your character sentence—and the most important choice you'll make.

> "I am a Haunted Muscle who **Never Misses**."

Your Focus determines:
- Your **signature abilities** as you advance
- Your **narrative permission**—what you can plausibly attempt

---

## Why Focus Matters Most

In most games, your class or archetype is the big choice. In Narraject, your **Focus** is.

Your Package tells you what you're good at. Your Focus tells you what makes you _special_.

Two Muscles can have completely different feels:
- A Muscle who **Bears a Halo of Fire** is a pyromancer knight
- A Muscle who **Never Backs Down** is an unbreakable tank
- A Muscle who **Strikes From Shadow** is an assassin

Same Package. Completely different characters.

---

## The Differentiation Rule

**No two player characters can share a Focus.**

This ensures every character has a unique mechanical identity and narrative niche.

If two players want the same Focus, negotiate. Perhaps one takes "Never Misses" (sniper fantasy) and the other takes "Strikes From Shadow" (assassin fantasy). Different expressions of similar concepts.

## Focus Abilities

Each Focus grants special abilities at each Tier. These are things **only you can do**—or that you do much better than others.

**Example: Never Misses**

| Tier | Ability                                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Called Shot:** When you hit, you can declare where you hit for narrative effect without penalty. |
| 2    | **One Shot, One Kill:** When you hit, deal +1 Condition severity. |
| 3    | **Inevitable:** Once per session, you can declare a shot hits automatically—no roll. Describe the perfection. |

These abilities stack. A Tier 3 "Never Misses" character has all three.

## Narrative Permission

Your Focus grants implicit permission to attempt things others can't—or to do them without penalty.

**"Never Misses"** lets you:
- Assess any shot (range, wind, obstacles) without a roll
- Know firearms intimately (model, origin, modification)
- Attempt "impossible" shots where others couldn't try

**"Bears a Halo of Fire"** lets you:
- Create fire from nothing
- Resist heat and flame
- Sense heat signatures

The GM should say "yes" to actions that fit your Focus, even if they'd require rolls for others.

## Choosing Your Focus

Ask yourself:
1. **What do I want to be known for?** The thing the table thinks of when they think of your character.
2. **What fantasies do I want to fulfill?** The cool moments you're imagining.
3. **How do I want to solve problems?** Violence? Stealth? Magic? Charm? Knowledge?

Your Focus should answer all three.

## Sample Foci

Here are some examples:

| Focus | Domain | Tier 1 Ability |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Never Misses** | Ranged Combat | Called Shot |
| **Bears a Halo of Fire** | Pyromancy | Ignite (create fire) |
| **Solves Mysteries** | Investigation | Deduce (ask GM one true fact) |
| **Commands the Dead** | Necromancy | Speak with Corpse |
| **Moves Like Water** | Martial Arts | Flow (ignore difficult terrain in combat) |
| **Speaks with Authority** | Leadership | Inspire (+1d6 to ally's roll) |
| **Knows Too Much** | Occult Knowledge | Forbidden Lore (identify supernatural) |
| **Never Backs Down** | Resilience | Unbreakable (reduce incoming damage by 1) |
| **Strikes From Shadow** | Assassination | Ambush (first attack is +1d6) |
| **Builds Impossible Things** | Engineering | Improvise Gear (create temporary equipment) |

## Creating New Foci

If none of the provided Foci fit your character concept, work with your GM to create one.

**Focus Design Guidelines:**

1. **The phrase should be evocative.** "Controls Gravity" is better than "Gravity Powers."
2. **The domain should be clear.** What situations trigger your Focus abilities?
3. **Tier 1 should be useful immediately.** Don't front-load the cool stuff at Tier 3.
4. **Each tier should feel different.** Not just "more damage"—new capabilities.
5. **Narrative permission matters.** What can you do without rolling?

**Template:**

```
FOCUS: [Verb Phrase]
Domain: [When does this apply?]

Tier 1: [Ability Name] — [Description]
Tier 2: [Ability Name] — [Description]
Tier 3: [Ability Name] — [Description]

Narrative Permission: [What can you attempt or know without rolls?]
```

## Focus and Injections

Your Focus abilities are separate from **Injections**. Injections are special abilities you unlock and define on your character sheet, each with an assigned Injector Die (d4-d12).

Focus abilities are always available when you're in your domain. Injections cost IP to activate and add an Injector Die to your roll.

Your Focus is your specialty. When you're in your domain, you shine. That's the point.

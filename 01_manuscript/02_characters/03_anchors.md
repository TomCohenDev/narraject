# Anchors: Your Character's Foundation

Anchors are the backgrounds, skills, training, and experiences that ground your character in the world. They represent established facts about who you are and what you know—elements you can inject into scenes to help overcome challenges.

**Mechanically:** Anchors are pure advantage. They add dice to your pools when relevant. They never hinder you—that's what Burdens are for.

**Narratively:** Anchors tell us who you are and what you've done with your life. They suggest story hooks, relationships, and expertise. They're narrative permission to say "I know this" or "I've done this before."

## The Rule of Balance

**You must have 1 Burden for every 1 Anchor you possess.**

This ensures characters have both strengths and weaknesses. If you have 4 Anchors, you must have 4 Burdens. If you gain a new Anchor through advancement, you must also gain a new Burden (or deepen an existing one).

## Anchor Impact

Anchors come in three impact levels, representing your level of mastery:

| Impact       | Bonus | What It Represents                          |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Minor**    | +1d6  | Relevant background, training, or skill     |
| **Moderate** | +2d6  | Specialized expertise or significant talent |
| **Major**    | +3d6  | Exceptional mastery, world-class ability    |

You advance Anchors through play by spending Narrative Points (see Progression). Most characters start with Minor and Moderate Anchors.

## When Anchors Apply

An Anchor applies when the fiction supports it. If you're hacking a computer and you have the Anchor "Hacker," that's relevant—add your dice. If you're arm-wrestling and you have "Hacker," it doesn't apply.

The GM makes the final call, but be generous—if the player can make a case for why their Anchor matters, let them use it.

**Important:** Only ONE Anchor applies per roll, even if multiple seem relevant. Choose the most applicable one.

---

## Broad vs. Specific Anchors

Anchors can be **Broad** or **Specific**. The scope affects WHEN they apply, not the mechanical bonus.

### Broad Anchors

Apply to many situations, but might be less evocative.

**Examples:**
- Athletics
- Combat
- Social
- Technology
- Stealth
- Investigation

**Pros:** Come up frequently, versatile
**Cons:** Less narrative flavor, less unique

### Specific Anchors

Apply to narrower situations, but create richer story hooks.

**Examples:**
- Expert Marksman (instead of "Combat")
- Cat Burglar (instead of "Stealth")
- Military Veteran (instead of "Combat")
- Street Racer (instead of "Driving")
- Forensic Pathologist (instead of "Investigation")

**Pros:** Memorable, suggest backstory, create narrative hooks
**Cons:** Come up less often

### The Sweet Spot

The best Anchors are **specific enough to be interesting, broad enough to be useful**.

- **Too Broad:** "Good at Things" (applies to everything, meaningless)
- **Too Specific:** "Can Pick Victorian-Era Padlocks While Blindfolded" (almost never comes up)
- **Just Right:** "Expert Lockpick" or "Trained in Covert Entry"

**Guideline:** Good balanced Anchors will be invoked between 5-7 times per session. If it comes up constantly, it might be too broad. If it never comes up, it's too narrow.

## Creating Good Anchors

### 1. Start with the Fiction

Don't think mechanically first. Think about your character's life:
- What have they done for a living?
- What did they study or train in?
- What hobbies or passions do they have?
- What reputation precedes them?
- What culture or organization shaped them?

Once you have answers, turn them into Anchors.

**Example:** "My character was a military medic before becoming a mercenary."

That suggests:
- Combat Trained (Moderate) - from military service
- Field Medicine (Minor) - from medic training
- Iron Nerves (Minor) - from working under fire

### 2. Make It Evocative

Anchors should paint a picture. They should make people at the table say "oh, cool!" or "I want to know more about that."

**Boring:** Shooting
**Better:** Marksman
**Best:** Sniper, Never Misses, Deadeye, Long-Range Specialist

**Boring:** Smart
**Better:** Scholar
**Best:** Ancient Historian, Forensic Analyst, Arcane Researcher

The more specific and evocative your Anchor, the more story hooks it creates. Your GM can introduce NPCs from your past, complications tied to your expertise, or challenges that test your specialty.

### 3. Think About Relationships

Some of the best Anchors imply connections to the world:

- **Organizations:** "Undercover Fed," "Guild Assassin," "Corporate Heir"
- **Reputations:** "Famous Detective," "Wanted Outlaw," "Legendary Duelist"
- **Mentors/Rivals:** "Trained by Major Chen," "Rival of the Crimson Hand"
- **Cultural Ties:** "Daughter of the Wastes," "City Guard Veteran," "Nomad Trader"

These Anchors not only add dice—they give the GM ammunition for creating personal stakes.

### 4. Vary Your Portfolio

Don't make all your Anchors the same type. A character with:
- Expert Swordsman (Moderate)
- Major Duelist (Major)
- Combat Veteran (Minor)
- Trained in Fencing (Minor)

...is one-note. They're VERY good at fighting, but have no other dimensions.

Compare that to:
- Expert Swordsman (Moderate)
- Noble-Born (Minor)
- Tactical Mind (Minor)
- Silver Tongue (Minor)

Now you have a character who's not just a fighter—they're a noble with social graces, tactical acumen, and a signature combat style. That's richer.

**Aim for diversity:** Combat, social, knowledge, technical, physical, sensory. Give the GM lots of ways to involve your character.

### 5. Consider Action Economy

In Narraject, you're building dice pools. Anchors that apply to your PRIMARY actions (the things you'll do most often) should generally be Moderate or Major tier.

Anchors that apply to SECONDARY actions (things you do occasionally) can be Minor tier.

**Example Combat Character:**
- Close Combat Specialist (Moderate) - your bread and butter
- Intimidating Presence (Minor) - occasionally useful
- Urban Navigation (Minor) - situational but helpful

This ensures you're effective at your core role while having breadth.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Anchors That Are Just Stats

**Bad:** "Strong" (that's what Might is for)
**Bad:** "Smart" (that's what Intellect is for)
**Bad:** "Fast" (that's what Agility is for)

Anchors should represent TRAINING, KNOWLEDGE, or BACKGROUND, not raw attributes.

**Good:** "Olympic Wrestler" (training in using Might)
**Good:** "Engineering Degree" (knowledge using Intellect)

### 2. Boring Anchors That Are Always On

**Bad:** "Lucky" (when does this NOT apply?)
**Bad:** "Determined" (too vague, always relevant)
**Bad:** "Competent" (meaningless)

If an Anchor applies to EVERY roll, it's not an Anchor. It's just a bonus to your stats.

### 3. Anchors That Are Really Burdens

Remember: **Anchors ONLY help. They never hinder.**

**Bad:** "Hotheaded" (this creates problems—it's a Burden)
**Bad:** "Overconfident" (this is a Burden)
**Bad:** "Haunted by the Past" (this is a Burden)

If it complicates your life, it's a Burden. Anchors are competencies, not complications.

### 4. Anchor Names That Don't Say Anything

**Bad:** "Background #1"
**Bad:** "Training"
**Bad:** "Skill"

Anchors should be flavorful and specific. They're on your character sheet for the whole campaign—make them sing.

## Anchor + Burden Pairs

The Rule of Balance means every Anchor has a corresponding Burden. You don't have to link them explicitly, but sometimes it makes sense to create pairs:

**Anchor:** Military Veteran (Moderate)
**Burden:** PTSD from the War (Moderate penalty in high-stress combat)

**Anchor:** Major Hacker (Major)
**Burden:** Wanted by Megacorp Security (narrative complication)

**Anchor:** Noble-Born (Minor)
**Burden:** Obligation to the Family (narrative burden)

This creates rich characters—your strengths come with costs, your expertise comes with history.

---

## Examples: Good vs. Better vs. Best

### Example 1: The Fighter

**Good:** Combat
**Better:** Swordsman
**Best:** Bladesmaster of the Northern School

### Example 2: The Hacker

**Good:** Technology
**Better:** Hacker
**Best:** Ghost in the Net, Corporate Security Cracker, Code Breaker

### Example 3: The Investigator

**Good:** Investigation
**Better:** Detective
**Best:** Forensic Specialist, Reads Crime Scenes Like Books, Private Eye with a Nose for Lies

### Example 4: The Pilot

**Good:** Driving
**Better:** Pilot
**Best:** Ace Starfighter Pilot, Flown Everything That Flies, Smuggler's Route Expert

---

## Anchor Collaboration

**Work with your GM and table when creating Anchors.**

When you write down an Anchor, you're not just claiming a mechanical bonus—you're introducing facts about the world:

- "Guild Assassin" suggests a Guild exists
- "Trained by Major Chen" suggests Major Chen exists (and might appear in-game)
- "Wanted Outlaw" suggests you have a criminal past the GM can exploit

The GM should ask questions:
- "What's the Guild like?"
- "Tell me about Major Chen—friend or foe now?"
- "What did you do to get that bounty?"

Your answers create the world together.

---

## Starting Anchors

Most starting characters have **3-5 Anchors** (and therefore 3-5 Burdens):
- 1-2 Moderate Anchors (your specialties)
- 2-3 Minor Anchors (your breadth)

---

## Advancing Anchors

You can improve Anchors through advancement by spending Narrative Points:
- **Minor → Moderate:** Costs 2 NP + narrative justification
- **Moderate → Major:** Costs 3 NP + narrative justification
- **New Minor Anchor:** Costs 2 NP + new Burden

See **Progression** and **The Economy** for details.

## GM Guidance: When Anchors Apply

As GM, be generous with Anchor applicability. If a player makes a reasonable case for why their Anchor helps, let them use it.

**Player:** "I want to use my 'Military Veteran' Anchor to organize the villagers into a defensive formation."
**GM:** "Absolutely. That makes perfect sense. Add your dice."

The only time to say no is when the Anchor genuinely doesn't apply:

**Player:** "I want to use my 'Expert Hacker' Anchor to punch this guy."
**GM:** "How does hacking help you punch?"
**Player:** "Uh... never mind."

When in doubt, ask the player to justify it in the fiction. If they can sell it narratively, allow it mechanically.

---

## Anchor Template

When creating a new Anchor, ask yourself:

1. **What does this Anchor represent?** (background, training, reputation, skill)
2. **When does it apply?** (give 2-3 example situations)
3. **What tier is it?** (Minor, Moderate, Major)
4. **What story hooks does it create?** (relationships, obligations, complications)
5. **What's the matching Burden?** (remember the Rule of Balance)

If you can answer all five, you have a good Anchor.

---

## Final Thought

**Anchors are love letters to the GM.**

Every Anchor you write is a request: "I want this to matter in the story. I want scenes where this expertise is tested. I want NPCs who care about this background. I want my character's history to create drama."

The more evocative and specific your Anchors, the more ammunition you give your GM to make the game personal.

So make them count. Make them sing. Make them matter.

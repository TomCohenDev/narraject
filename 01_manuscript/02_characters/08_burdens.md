# Burdens

Burdens are vulnerabilities you create for your character—narrative hooks, complications, and weaknesses that the GM can use to make the story personal.

**Think of them as knives:** You lovingly forge them and hand them to the GM so the GM can stab you with them over and over again.

That sounds terrible. It's actually brilliant.

## Why Burdens Matter

In a game where success means your intent happens (period), Burdens are what create tension. They're moments when the dice aren't enough. When your past catches up. When your fears manifest. When the universe reminds you that you're not invincible.

**Mechanically,** Burdens remove dice from your pool when they apply.

**Narratively,** Burdens give the GM ammunition to make your character's story _matter and interesting_. They transform generic encounters into personal stakes. They create drama. They make you vulnerable.

And when you play your Burdens honestly—when you let them complicate your life—you earn **Narrative Points** for it.

## The Rule of Balance

**You must have 1 Burden for every 1 Anchor you possess.**

This ensures characters have both strengths and weaknesses. If you have 4 Anchors, you must have 4 Burdens. If you gain a new Anchor, you must also gain a new Burden OR deepen an existing Burden.

Burdens are a mix of mechanical penalties and narrative complications that the GM can pull from to make every session feel personal.

## Types of Burdens: Building Your Knife Block

When creating your character, aim for **variety** in your Burdens. Mix mechanical penalties with narrative hooks. Give the GM different tools to work with.

Here are categories to consider:

### 1. People You Care About
**Living or dead.** Named NPCs the GM can threaten, manipulate, or bring back into your life.

- Your sibling who thinks you're dead
- The mentor you betrayed
- The spouse you left behind
- The childhood friend who became your rival
- The parent who disowned you

**Mechanical Effect:** Minor to Moderate penalty when they're threatened or present.

### 2. Phobias and Trauma
**Things that make you freeze, panic, or lose control.**

- Claustrophobia (tight spaces)
- Pyrophobia (fire)
- Heights
- Crowds
- Darkness
- Specific enemy types (e.g., undead, machines)

**Mechanical Effect:** Moderate to Major penalty in trigger situations.

### 3. Mysteries in Your Past
**Unanswered questions that haunt you.**

- Unknown parents
- Unexplained powers
- Missing time
- A prophecy about you
- The reason you survived when others didn't

**Mechanical Effect:** Usually narrative only, but can impose penalties when the mystery is directly relevant.

### 4. Enemies and Rivals
**Named antagonists who want you dead, captured, or broken.**

- The crime boss you testified against
- The rival who blames you for their downfall
- The organization hunting you
- The ex-partner who swore revenge

**Mechanical Effect:** Minor penalty when they're near, or narrative complications when they appear.

### 5. Obligations and Loyalties
**Debts, oaths, or commitments that constrain you.**

- You owe someone a favor
- You're sworn to protect someone
- You must follow a code
- You're bound to an organization
- You promised to never use violence

**Mechanical Effect:** Penalties when violating the obligation, or complications when it conflicts with the mission.

### 6. Failed Obligations
**Promises you broke. Duties you abandoned.**

- The mission you failed
- The person you couldn't save
- The oath you violated
- The team you left behind

**Mechanical Effect:** Moderate penalty in situations that remind you of the failure.

### 7. Crimes and Secrets
**Things you've done. Things you're hiding.**

- A murder (justified or not)
- Desertion
- Theft of something important
- Betrayal of trust
- False accusations you're avoiding

**Mechanical Effect:** Major penalty if exposed, or narrative complications when secrecy is threatened.

### 8. Discrimination Experienced
**Prejudice, marginalization, or systemic barriers.**

- Fantasy racism (elf/dwarf/orc)
- Social class barriers
- Religious persecution
- Outlawed profession
- Visible augmentation stigma

**Mechanical Effect:** Minor to Moderate penalty in hostile social situations.

### 9. Prized Possessions
**Items you'll risk everything to protect or recover.**

- Family heirloom
- Magical artifact
- Last gift from a dead loved one
- Proof of your innocence
- Your ship/vehicle/home

**Mechanical Effect:** Minor penalty when separated from it, or narrative hooks when it's threatened.

### 10. Physical Limitations
**Disabilities, injuries, or conditions that hinder you.**

- Missing limb
- Chronic pain
- Poor vision/hearing
- Respiratory condition
- Addiction

**Mechanical Effect:** Moderate to Major penalty on relevant actions.

### 11. Personality Flaws
**Character traits that get you in trouble.**

## Forging Your Burdens: Collaboration with the GM

**Before the game starts**, sit down with your GM and discuss your Burdens. This isn't just a mechanical exercise—you're handing the GM narrative ammunition.

Ask these questions together:

1. **Which Burdens are mechanical?** (Dice penalties) Which are purely narrative hooks?
2. **How severe is each Burden?** Minor, Moderate, or Major?
3. **When do they apply?** Define clear triggers.
4. **Can the GM introduce these Burdens without warning?** Or should they telegraph them first?
5. **Are any Burdens off-limits?** (Topics you don't want explored in-game)

**Example Conversation:**

> **Player:** "I have a Burden: my sister Kara thinks I'm dead. She's a corporate exec now."
> **GM:** "Perfect. So if she shows up, what happens?"
> **Player:** "Minor penalty to social rolls when she's present—I'm distracted."

**That's a good knife.** Sharp, specific, and ready to stab.

## How the GM Uses Your Burdens

The GM has permission to stab you with your knives **at any time**. That's the deal. But good GMs use them thoughtfully:

### Mechanical Application
When a Burden applies to a situation, it removes dice from your pool:

- **Minor Burden:** -1d6 (nuisance)
- **Moderate Burden:** -2d6 (significant hindrance)
- **Major Burden:** -3d6 (major obstacle)

**Example:** You have "Claustrophobic (Moderate)" and you're crawling through a ventilation shaft. The GM says: "You're taking -2d6 from your Agility pool. Your hands are shaking."

### Narrative Application
The GM can also use Burdens to introduce complications, raise stakes, or create dramatic moments:

- Your enemy from the backstory shows up at the worst time
- Your secret is about to be exposed
- Your loved one is in danger
- Your phobia triggers in a critical moment
- Your obligation conflicts with the mission

**Example:** You have "Sister (Kara) thinks I'm dead." The GM says: "As you enter the corporate lobby, you see her. She's walking toward you. She hasn't seen you yet. What do you do?"

### The Stab-and-Reward Cycle
When a Burden **meaningfully complicates your life**—causes a failure, forces a difficult choice, or creates dramatic tension—the GM can and should award you **1 NP** if the Burden plays out well and creates a good story.

This creates a beautiful loop:
1. GM stabs you with your Burden
2. You play it honestly (take the penalty, roleplay the complication)
3. GM rewards you with NP
4. You spend NP later to advance your character

**Burdens make you vulnerable. NPs make you grow. The cycle continues.**

### When NOT to Award NP (Boring Stab)

**Example:** You have "Claustrophobic (Moderate)" and you're crawling through a dungeon corridor.

**GM:** "The walls are tight here. Take -2d6 to your Agility pool."
**Player:** *Rolls with the penalty, succeeds, moves on*

**No NP awarded.** Why? The Burden applied mechanically, but it didn't create drama. It was just a tax on the dice pool. The player didn't make a difficult choice, experience narrative tension, or create a memorable moment. It was routine.

**This is fine.** Not every Burden trigger needs to be epic. But routine penalties don't earn NPs.

### When to Award NP (Good Stab)

**Same Burden, Same Corridor. Different Choices.**

**GM:** "The walls are closing in. The corridor narrows to barely shoulder-width. You hear voices behind you—the guards are coming. You need to crawl through fast."

**Player:** *Panics* "No. No, I can't. My chest is tightening. I'm starting to hyperventilate."

**GM:** "The voices are getting closer. Your party is ahead—they're through the narrow section, waving you forward. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I... I try to push forward, but I'm shaking. Can I still make the Agility roll?"

**GM:** "Yes, but you're at -2d6 from the claustrophobia. And the guards will spot you in seconds if you don't move NOW."

**Player:** *Rolls, fails* "I freeze. I can't move. I'm stuck."

**GM:** "Your teammate reaches back: 'Grab my hand! NOW!' The guards round the corner. They see you."

**Player:** "I grab their hand. I let them pull me, even though every instinct is screaming to back out. I'm crying, I'm terrified, but I trust them."

**GM:** "You're dragged through, gasping. The guards open fire just as you clear the gap. Your party slams a door shut. You're safe—but you're a wreck."

**Award 1 NP.** Why? Same Burden, same mechanical penalty—but this time:
1. **The player roleplayed the panic honestly** (hyperventilating, freezing, crying)
2. **The failure created dramatic tension** (guards spotted them, party had to intervene)
3. **A difficult choice emerged** (trust the teammate vs. flee back)
4. **Character relationships deepened** (vulnerability shown, trust built)
5. **The moment mattered** (everyone at the table felt it)

The difference isn't the Burden. It's **how the player and GM engaged with it**. One was mechanical. The other was a knife to the heart.

## When Burdens Apply

A Burden applies when:
- The situation directly triggers your weakness
- Your fear or limitation would realistically hinder you
- The narrative benefit outweighs the mechanical penalty

**The GM decides, but players can invoke their own Burdens** to earn NP. If you see an opportunity to make your life harder for narrative drama, ask: "Does my Burden apply here?"

Good GMs will say yes and consider awarding you NP if you play it well.

---

## Variety Matters

Don't make all your Burdens the same type. A character with 7 phobias is one-note. A character with:
- A sister who thinks they're dead
- Claustrophobia
- A rival who swore revenge
- Overconfidence
- A secret murder
- Loyalty to a shady organization
- A prized family heirloom

**That's a rich character.** The GM has options. Some Burdens are mechanical. Some are narrative. Some are both. Mix it up.

---

## Bundling Burdens (Advanced)

GMs can combine multiple characters' Burdens into one giant knife:

**Example:**
- Character A has Burden: "Sister Kara (corporate exec)"
- Character B has Burden: "Rival named Marcus (wants revenge)"
- GM's twist: Kara and Marcus are dating

**Suddenly two knives become one massive blade.** Both characters are stabbed simultaneously. Drama ensues. NPs are earned.

This is advanced GMing, but when it works, it's magical.

---

## Burdens and Progression

As you gain new Anchors through advancement, you must also gain new Burdens. The Rule of Balance persists.

You **can reduce or remove Burdens** through NP expenditure (3 NP to reduce severity or remove a Minor Burden), but it requires narrative resolution:

- Therapy for trauma
- Reconciliation with estranged loved ones
- Defeating your rival
- Solving the mystery
- Paying your debts

With GM approval, resolved Burdens might:
- Reduce in severity (Major → Moderate)
- Change nature (enemy becomes uneasy ally)
- Become narrative victories (the heirloom is recovered)

If a Burden is narratively removed without NP cost (through exceptional roleplay or story resolution), the GM might reward the player with bonus NP, depending on how meaningful the resolution was.

---

## For GMs: How to Stab Effectively

**Use Burdens to**:
1. **Personalize generic encounters.** The random guard? He's your character's old squadmate.
2. **Raise stakes.** The bomb isn't in a warehouse—it's in your sister's apartment.
3. **Create difficult choices.** Save the mission or save your loved one?
4. **Generate NPs.** When you stab, consider rewarding the player for bleeding well.

**Don't**:
1. **Stab too often.** A Burden used every scene loses impact.
2. **Stab without variety.** Rotate through different characters' Burdens.
3. **Forget to reward.** Meaningful complications deserve NPs.
4. **Cross boundaries.** Honor off-limits topics discussed in Session Zero.
5. **Stop successful plans.** Let the players have their hard-earned wins.

**The players gave you these knives because they trust you to use them well.**

## Quick Reference

| Burden Severity | Dice Penalty | When to Use                                     |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Minor**       | -1d6         | Nuisance that complicates but doesn't cripple   |
| **Moderate**    | -2d6         | Significant hindrance requiring adaptation      |
| **Major**      | -3d6         | Major obstacle or fail-state condition          |

**NP reward:** 1 NP when a Burden meaningfully complicates the story (GM discretion)

---

## Final Thought

Burdens aren't weaknesses to hide. They're invitations to drama. They're promises that your character's story will matter—that the GM won't just throw generic obstacles at you, but will craft complications that cut deep.

**Forge your knives with care. Hand them to your GM with trust. Then enjoy the beautiful, bloody story that follows.**

# Gear

Don't list 100 guns. List **Tags**.

## Gear Tags

Gear has **Tags** that describe what it does:

| Tag      | Effect                                    |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Ranged** | Can hit Far zone                          |
| **Loud**   | Triggers detection checks                 |
| **Quality** | Adds +1d6 to relevant rolls                |
| **Concealable** | Easy to hide                              |
| **Versatile** | Works in multiple situations               |
| **Consumable** | One-time use                              |

**Example:** A rifle might have [Ranged, Quality, Loud]. A lockpick might have [Concealable, Quality].

## Gear Quality

| Quality    | Bonus |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Standard   | +1d6  |
| Quality    | +2d6  |
| Masterwork | +3d6  |

Most starting gear is Standard or Quality. Masterwork is rare and expensive.

---

## Weapons

Weapons add dice to attack pools:

| Weapon Type | Bonus |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Improvised  | +0d6  |
| Standard    | +1d6  |
| Quality     | +2d6  |
| Masterwork  | +3d6  |

A sword helps you fight. A rifle helps you shoot. Use what makes sense.

## Armor

Armor doesn't add dice. Instead, it **reduces Condition severity**.

| Armor Type | Effect                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Light      | Reduce Condition by 1 level |
| Medium     | Reduce Condition by 2 levels |
| Heavy      | Reduce Condition by 3 levels |

**Example:** You take a hit that would inflict Wounded. You're wearing Medium armor. You become Hurt instead.

Armor can't reduce below Hurt. Even in full plate, a solid hit still hurts.

---

## Consumables

Some items are **Consumable**—one-time use:

- Medkits (remove one Condition)
- Ammo (reload ranged weapons)
- Tools (temporary +1d6 bonus)
- Supplies (survival, crafting, etc.)

Track these. When they're gone, they're gone.

## Starting Gear

Your Package suggests appropriate starting equipment. Work with your GM to customize based on your character concept.

The goal is gear that supports your playstyle, not a shopping list.

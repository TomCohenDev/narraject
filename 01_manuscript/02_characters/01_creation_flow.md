# Creating Your Character

Your character is defined by a single sentence:

> **"I am a [Descriptor] [Type] who [Focus]."**

Each part does something different:

- **Descriptor** (the adjective): Who you are as a person. Adds flavor, minor bonuses, and a flaw.
- **Type** (the noun): What you fundamentally do. Sets your base stats and core ability.
- **Focus** (the verb phrase): Your signature specialty. Determines your unique powers and abilities.

**Example:** _"I am a Haunted Warrior who Never Misses."_

## The Process

1. **Choose your Focus first.** This is the most important decision—it determines your character's signature specialty and grants abilities.

2. **Choose your Package.** This sets your base stats and gives you a core ability.

3. **Choose your Descriptor.** This adds personality, a trait, and a flaw.

4. **Calculate your stats.** Package provides your Ratings and Reserve capacities.

5. **Select starting Traits.** Package and Descriptor give you some; you may choose others. **Remember:** You must have 1 Flaw for every 1 Trait (Rule of Balance).

6. **Define starting Injections.** Work with your GM to create 1-2 starting Injections, each with an assigned Injector Die (d4-d12).

7. **Gear up.** Your Package suggests appropriate starting equipment.

8. **Write your sentence.** Speak it aloud. If it sounds like someone you want to play, you're done.

## Time to Create

A new character takes **20-30 minutes**. Experienced players can do it in 10.

If you're stuck, ask the table: "What kind of character would be fun to have around?" Sometimes the answer sparks something.

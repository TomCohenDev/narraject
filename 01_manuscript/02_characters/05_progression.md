# Progression

Characters advance through **Tiers**. Each Tier unlocks new abilities and increases your Step Die.

## The Upgrade Wheel

At the end of each session, you may advance one of the following:

1. **Increase a Stat Rating** (max 5)
2. **Gain a new Trait** (Basic, Advanced, or Master)
3. **Upgrade a Trait** (Basic → Advanced → Master)
4. **Unlock a new Injection** (with assigned Injector Die)
5. **Upgrade an Injector Die** (d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12)

You can only advance one thing per session. Choose wisely.

## Injection Progression

As you advance, you can unlock new Injections or upgrade existing ones:

- **Unlock new Injections:** Add new special abilities to your sheet (each with an assigned Injector Die)
- **Upgrade Injector Dice:** Step up a die (d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12) for an existing Injection

---

## Stat Increases

Increasing a Stat Rating:
- Increases your minimum dice for that stat
- Increases your Reserve capacity (Capacity = Rating × 2 + 5)
- May unlock new abilities (GM discretion)

Maximum Rating is 5. Most characters will cap at 3-4.

## New Traits

Gaining a new Trait:
- Adds +1d6 (Basic), +2d6 (Advanced), or +3d6 (Master) when relevant
- Represents new skills, backgrounds, or knacks
- Can be **Broad** ("Athletics") or **Specific** ("Underwater Basket Weaving")
- Must be relevant to your character concept
- **Remember:** You must also gain a new Flaw to maintain the Rule of Balance (1 Flaw per 1 Trait)

Work with your GM to ensure new Traits fit your character's story.

## Milestone Advancement

The GM may award milestone advancements for:
- Completing major story arcs
- Achieving personal goals
- Exceptional play

These are in addition to session-end advancements. Use them sparingly.

---

## The Cap

Characters typically cap at:
- Rating 4-5 in primary stats
- 5-7 Traits total
- 3-5 Injections total
- Injector Dice at d10 or d12 for primary Injections

Beyond this, advancement becomes narrative rather than mechanical. You're already a legend.

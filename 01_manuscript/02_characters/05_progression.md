# Progression

Characters advance through **Narrative Points (NP)** earned during play. You spend NP to improve your character mechanically and narratively.

---

## How Progression Works

Between sessions (or during downtime), you can spend NP to:

1. **Upgrade an Anchor** (Minor → Moderate → Major)
2. **Gain a new Anchor** (with matching Burden)
3. **Increase a Stat Rating** (max 5)
4. **Reduce or Remove a Burden** (with narrative resolution)
5. **Unlock Setting-Specific Abilities** (future content - magic, cybernetics, etc.)

**Narrative justification required:** You must explain how your character earned the advancement. See **The Economy** for NP earning and spending details.

## Narrative Points Progression Costs

| Advancement                              | NP Cost | Notes                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Upgrade Anchor (Minor → Moderate)**    | 2 NP    | Requires narrative justification          |
| **Upgrade Anchor (Moderate → Major)**   | 3 NP    | Requires significant narrative moment     |
| **Add New Minor Anchor**                 | 2 NP    | Explain how you learned this              |
| **Add New Moderate Anchor**              | 4 NP    | Justify why you'd start at this level     |
| **Reduce Burden Severity (-3d6 → -2d6)** | 3 NP    | Requires narrative resolution             |
| **Remove Minor Burden (-1d6)**           | 3 NP    | Story must meaningfully address this      |
| **Increase Stat Rating**                 | 3 NP    | Represents deep training, max Rating 5    |
| **Unlock Setting Ability** (future)      | Varies  | Per setting package (magic, psionics, etc.) |

## Stat Increases

Increasing a Stat Rating costs **3 NP** and requires narrative justification.

**What it does:**
- Increases your minimum dice for that stat (Rating = Xd6)
- Increases your Reserve capacity (Capacity = Rating × 2 + 5, or Rating × 3 + 2 for Rating 6-10)
- Increases your Focus limit (Focus = Rating + 2)

**Maximum Rating is 5** for most campaigns. Legendary campaigns might allow Rating 6-10, but these are rare.

**Example:** You have Might 2 (Reserve: 9, Focus: 4). You spend 3 NP and narrate: "During our downtime, I trained daily with the veteran soldier, pushing my body to its limits." Your Might increases to 3 (Reserve: 11, Focus: 5).

## New Anchors

Gaining a new Anchor requires:
- **2 NP for Minor Anchor** (or 4 NP for Moderate)
- **Narrative justification** (how did you learn this?)
- **A matching Burden** (Rule of Balance - 1 Burden per 1 Anchor)

**Example:**

**Player:** "I want to add 'Ancient History (Minor)' as an Anchor. We've been exploring ruins for three sessions, and I've been studying the inscriptions. I spend 2 NP."

**GM:** "Great. What's the matching Burden?"

**Player:** "My obsession with the ruins is distracting me. I'll add 'Obsessed with Uncovering the Truth (Minor)' as a Burden—I get -1d6 when my curiosity conflicts with practical needs."

**GM:** "Perfect. You now have 'Ancient History (Minor)' as an Anchor."

---

## Upgrading Anchors

You can upgrade existing Anchors:
- **Minor → Moderate:** 2 NP + narrative justification
- **Moderate → Major:** 3 NP + narrative justification

**Example:**

**Player:** "I want to upgrade my 'Combat Training (Minor)' to Moderate. We've been in brutal fights for the last four sessions, and I've been training with the mercenary captain between missions. I spend 2 NP."

**GM:** "Makes sense. Your 'Combat Training' is now Moderate (+2d6 instead of +1d6)."

---

## Reducing or Removing Burdens

Burdens can be reduced or removed through NP expenditure, **but only with narrative resolution**:

- **Reduce Burden Severity:** 3 NP + narrative resolution (Major → Moderate, or Moderate → Minor)
- **Remove Minor Burden:** 3 NP + narrative resolution

**Example:**

**Player:** "I want to reduce my 'Fear of Fire (Moderate, -2d6)' Burden. Last session, I faced my fear by diving into the burning building to save my teammate. I've been confronting the trauma in downtime. I spend 3 NP."

**GM:** "That makes sense. Your fear isn't gone, but it's manageable now. 'Fear of Fire' is reduced to Minor (-1d6)."

**Major and Moderate Burdens** require significant narrative work to overcome. The GM should challenge players to earn these removals through story, not just NP.

**Alternative:** If a Burden is narratively resolved through exceptional roleplay without NP, the GM can remove it for free and may award bonus NP for the story resolution.

---

## Milestone Advancement (Optional)

GMs can grant **milestone advancements** independent of NP:

- Completing major story arcs
- Defeating significant threats
- Achieving personal character goals
- Surviving epic challenges

**Milestone rewards can be:**
- Free Anchor upgrade (no NP cost)
- Bonus NP (beyond session cap)
- Unlocking unique abilities
- Narrative advancements (reputation, titles, resources)

Milestones are in addition to normal NP progression. Use them sparingly for truly epic moments.

---

## Setting-Specific Abilities (Future)

When setting-specific content is released (magic systems, cybernetics, psionics, superhuman abilities), they will integrate with the NP progression system.

**Example (Future Content):**
- **Unlock Minor Spell:** 2 NP + in-game training
- **Upgrade Spell Potency:** 3 NP
- **Learn Moderate Magical School:** 5 NP + quest completion

These systems will be modular—GMs can add them to their campaign or ignore them entirely.

**For now:** The core Narraject system does not include setting-specific abilities. They will be released as expansion content.

## Progression Pacing

How fast characters advance depends on NP award rate:

### Slow Progression (Gritty Campaigns)
- 1 NP per player per session average
- Characters advance every 2-3 sessions
- Long-term growth, deep immersion

### Standard Progression (Most Campaigns)
- 1-2 NP per player per session average
- Characters advance every 1-2 sessions
- Balanced pacing

### Fast Progression (Heroic/Epic Campaigns)
- 2-3 NP per player per session average (with GM bonus awards)
- Characters advance every session
- Rapid growth, pulp action

**Recommended:** Start with Standard Progression and adjust based on table preference.

---

## The Cap

Characters typically cap at:
- **Rating 4-5** in primary stats
- **5-7 Anchors total**
- **Moderate or Major tier** in 2-3 primary Anchors
- **Balanced Burdens** to match

Beyond this, advancement becomes narrative rather than mechanical. You're already a legend.

**Epic Tier (Optional):** Some campaigns allow Rating 6-10 and more Anchors for legendary heroes. These characters are mythic-level.

---

## Example Progression Path

**Starting Character (Session 0):**
- Might 2, Agility 3, Intellect 2, Persona 2
- Anchors: Close Combat (Moderate), Urban Navigation (Minor), Fast Talk (Minor), Underworld Contacts (Minor)
- Burdens: Wanted by Law, Greedy, Trust No One, Rival Thief
- NP: 0

**After Session 1:**
- Earned 2 NP (played Burden well, used Narrative Injection creatively)
- Spent 2 NP: Upgraded "Fast Talk (Minor)" → "Fast Talk (Moderate)"
  - Narrative: "After talking our way out of three dangerous situations, I've gotten really good at this."
- NP: 0

**After Session 3:**
- Earned 4 NP total across two sessions (2 per session)
- Spent 4 NP: Added "Major Lockpick (Moderate)" + matching Burden "Overconfident (-1d6)"
  - Narrative: "I've been practicing on every lock we find. I'm getting cocky about it."
- NP: 0

**After Session 6:**
- Earned 6 NP total (2 per session for three sessions)
- Spent 3 NP: Increased Agility 3 → 4
  - Reserve goes from 11 → 13, Focus goes from 5 → 6
  - Narrative: "All this running, climbing, and fighting has made me faster."
- Spent 3 NP: Removed "Rival Thief" Burden
  - Narrative: "We confronted each other last session and made peace. The rivalry is over."
- NP: 0

**After Session 10:**
- Character is significantly stronger, with improved stats, better Anchors, and resolved Burdens
- Still balanced (Anchors = Burdens due to Rule of Balance)
- NP cycle continues

## GM Guidance: Awarding NP

See **The Economy** chapter for detailed NP award guidelines.

**Quick Tips:**
- Award 1 NP when players engage meaningfully with the narrative
- Aim for 1-2 NP per player per session
- NP should feel earned, not given
- Encourage players to spend NP between sessions (cap at 5 NP)

---

## Quick Reference

**Earn NP:** Play Burdens well, use Narrative Injection creatively, create story moments

**Spend NP:** Between sessions or downtime, with narrative justification

**Costs:** 2-4 NP for most advancements

**Cap:** 5 NP maximum stored

**Rule of Balance:** New Anchors require new Burdens

**Milestone Advancement:** Optional bonus rewards for epic moments

---

## Final Thought

Progression in Narraject isn't just about getting mechanically stronger. It's about growing your character narratively—facing your Burdens, mastering your skills, and becoming a legend.

**Spend your NP. Tell your story. Become who you're meant to be.**

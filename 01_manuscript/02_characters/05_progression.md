# Progression

Characters advance through **Tiers**. Each Tier unlocks new abilities and increases your Step Die.

---

## The Upgrade Wheel

At the end of each session, you may advance one of the following:

1. **Increase a Stat Rating** (max 5)
2. **Increase Step Die Tier** (d8 → d10 → d12)
3. **Gain a new Trait** (Basic or Advanced)
4. **Gain a new Focus Ability** (if you've reached the Tier)

You can only advance one thing per session. Choose wisely.

## Step Die Progression

| Tier | Step Die | Meaning              |
| ---- | -------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | d8       | Trained              |
| 2    | d10      | Expert               |
| 3    | d12      | Master               |

Everyone starts at Tier 1 with a d8 Step Die.

As you advance, your Step Die grows. By Tier 3, you're rolling a d12—the safest, most reliable expression of your identity.

## Focus Abilities

Each Focus grants special abilities at each Tier. These are things **only you can do**—or that you do much better than others.

**Example: Never Misses**

| Tier | Ability                                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Called Shot:** When you hit, you can declare where you hit for narrative effect without penalty. |
| 2    | **One Shot, One Kill:** If your Step Die is highest AND a Mark, deal +1 Condition severity. |
| 3    | **Inevitable:** Once per session, you can declare a shot hits automatically—no roll. Describe the perfection. |

These abilities stack. A Tier 3 "Never Misses" character has all three.

## Stat Increases

Increasing a Stat Rating:
- Increases your minimum dice for that stat
- Increases your Reserve capacity (Capacity = Rating × 2 + 5)
- May unlock new abilities (GM discretion)

Maximum Rating is 5. Most characters will cap at 3-4.

---

## New Traits

Gaining a new Trait:
- Adds +1d6 (Basic) or +2d6 (Advanced) when relevant
- Represents new skills, backgrounds, or knacks
- Must be relevant to your character concept

Work with your GM to ensure new Traits fit your character's story.

---

## Milestone Advancement

The GM may award milestone advancements for:
- Completing major story arcs
- Achieving personal goals
- Exceptional play

These are in addition to session-end advancements. Use them sparingly.

---

## The Cap

Characters typically cap at:
- Tier 3 Step Die (d12)
- Rating 4-5 in primary stats
- 5-7 Traits total

Beyond this, advancement becomes narrative rather than mechanical. You're already a legend.

# Stats and Capacity

Each character has four stats: **Might**, **Agility**, **Intellect**, and **Persona**.

Each stat has three values: **Rating**, **Reserve**, and **Effort**.

---

## Rating

Your **Rating** is your innate capability—what you can do even when exhausted, unprepared, or desperate. You always have your Rating.

Rating determines:
- Minimum dice you roll for that stat (Rating = Xd6)
- Your Reserve capacity
- Your Effort limit

---

## Reserve

Your **Reserve** is your total pool of spendable effort—it represents how much you can push yourself beyond your baseline across multiple actions. You spend from it to add dice, but it depletes and needs recovery.

**Capacity Formula:**
- **Rating 1-5:** Reserve = (Rating × 2) + 5
- **Rating 6-10:** Reserve = (Rating × 3) + 2

| Rating | Reserve Capacity |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| 1      | 7                |
| 2      | 9                |
| 3      | 11               |
| 4      | 13               |
| 5      | 15               |
| 6      | 20               |
| 7      | 23               |
| 8      | 26               |
| 9      | 29               |
| 10     | 32               |

Reserve capacity accelerates at higher ratings to allow legendary characters to consistently achieve heroic feats. Most starting characters have Ratings between 1-3.

You start each session with your Reserve at full capacity. It recovers during downtime (see Gameplay Loops).

## Effort

Your **Effort** is the maximum amount of Reserve you can spend on a **single roll**. Think of it as your burst capacity—how hard you can push in one moment.

**Why Effort Matters:**
- **Reserve** is your marathon capacity (how much total effort you have)
- **Effort** is your sprint capacity (how much you can use at once)

This prevents "nova" strategies where you dump your entire Reserve into one roll and then have nothing left.

**Effort Formula:**
- **Effort = Rating + 2**

| Rating | Effort Cap | Reserve Capacity | Example                                     |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | 3          | 7                | Can add up to +3d6 per roll, 7 total pool   |
| 2      | 4          | 9                | Can add up to +4d6 per roll, 9 total pool   |
| 3      | 5          | 11               | Can add up to +5d6 per roll, 11 total pool  |
| 4      | 6          | 13               | Can add up to +6d6 per roll, 13 total pool  |
| 5      | 7          | 15               | Can add up to +7d6 per roll, 15 total pool  |
| 6      | 9          | 20               | Can add up to +9d6 per roll, 20 total pool  |
| 7      | 10         | 23               | Can add up to +10d6 per roll, 23 total pool |
| 8      | 11         | 26               | Can add up to +11d6 per roll, 26 total pool |
| 9      | 12         | 29               | Can add up to +12d6 per roll, 29 total pool |
| 10     | 13         | 32               | Can add up to +13d6 per roll, 32 total pool |

**Example:**
You have Agility 3 (Reserve: 11, Effort: 5).

**First Roll:** You spend 5 Reserve to add +5d6. You now have 6 Reserve remaining.
**Second Roll:** You spend 4 Reserve to add +4d6. You now have 2 Reserve remaining.
**Third Roll:** You can only spend 2 Reserve to add +2d6 (even though your Effort cap is 5).

Each stat tracks its own Reserve and Effort independently.

## The Four Stats

| Stat        | What It Governs                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Might**   | Physical power, endurance, melee combat, resisting physical harm |
| **Agility** | Speed, reflexes, coordination, ranged combat, stealth, balance   |
| **Intellect**    | Knowledge, perception, reasoning, technical skills, memory       |
| **Persona** | Social influence, willpower, presence, deception, leadership     |

When you attempt an action, the GM tells you which stat applies based on your declared approach.

## Recovery

Your Reserve recovers during downtime:

- **Short Rest** (10 minutes): Recover 1 point per stat
- **Long Rest** (full night's sleep): Recover all Reserve
- **Extended Downtime** (days/weeks): Recover Reserve + remove Conditions

Conditions (from combat) require separate recovery (see Consequences).

---

## The Desperation Roll

What if your Reserve is empty, no traits apply, no gear helps, and the GM grants nothing?

You roll your **Stat Rating** in d6s. That's it.

You're never completely helpless.

# Stats and Capacity

Each character has four stats: **Might**, **Agility**, **Mind**, and **Persona**.

Each stat has two values: **Rating** and **Reserve**.

---

## Rating

Your **Rating** is your innate capability—what you can do even when exhausted, unprepared, or desperate. You always have your Rating.

Rating determines:
- Minimum dice you roll for that stat (Rating = Xd6)
- Your Reserve capacity

---

## Reserve

Your **Reserve** is spendable effort—pushing yourself beyond your baseline. You spend from it to add dice, but it depletes and needs recovery.

**Capacity Formula:** Reserve = (Rating × 2) + 5

| Rating | Capacity |
| ------ | -------- |
| 1      | 7        |
| 2      | 9        |
| 3      | 11       |
| 4      | 13       |
| 5      | 15       |

You start each session with your Reserve at full capacity. It recovers during downtime (see Gameplay Loops).

## The Four Stats

| Stat        | What It Governs                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Might**   | Physical power, endurance, melee combat, resisting physical harm |
| **Agility** | Speed, reflexes, coordination, ranged combat, stealth, balance   |
| **Mind**    | Knowledge, perception, reasoning, technical skills, memory       |
| **Persona** | Social influence, willpower, presence, deception, leadership     |

When you attempt an action, the GM tells you which stat applies based on your declared approach.

## Starting Stats

Your **Package** determines your starting Ratings and Reserve capacities.

See Packages for starting stat arrays.

---

## Recovery

Your Reserve recovers during downtime:

- **Short Rest** (10 minutes): Recover 1 point per stat
- **Long Rest** (full night's sleep): Recover all Reserve
- **Extended Downtime** (days/weeks): Recover Reserve + remove Conditions

Conditions (from combat) require separate recovery (see Consequences).

## The Desperation Roll

What if your Reserve is empty, no traits apply, no gear helps, and the GM grants nothing?

You roll your **Rating + Step Die**. That's it.

You're never completely helpless.

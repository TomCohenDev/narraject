# Traits: Your Competencies

Traits are the skills, backgrounds, training, and knacks that make your character competent. They add dice to your pools when they're relevant.

**Mechanically:** Traits are pure advantage. They never hinder you—that's what Flaws are for.

**Narratively:** Traits tell us who you are and what you've done with your life. They suggest story hooks, relationships, and expertise.

---

## The Rule of Balance

**You must have 1 Flaw for every 1 Trait you possess.**

This ensures characters have both strengths and weaknesses. If you have 4 Traits, you must have 4 Flaws. If you gain a new Trait through advancement, you must also gain a new Flaw (or deepen an existing one).

---

## Trait Tiers

Traits come in three tiers, representing your level of mastery:

| Tier         | Bonus | What It Represents                          |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic**    | +1d6  | Relevant background, training, or skill     |
| **Advanced** | +2d6  | Specialized expertise or significant talent |
| **Master**   | +3d6  | Exceptional mastery, world-class ability    |

You advance traits through play (see Progression). Most characters start with Basic and Advanced traits.

## When Traits Apply

A Trait applies when the fiction supports it. If you're hacking a computer and you have the trait "Hacker," that's relevant—add your dice. If you're arm-wrestling and you have "Hacker," it doesn't apply.

The GM makes the final call, but be generous—if the player can make a case for why their Trait matters, let them use it.

**Important:** Only ONE Trait applies per roll, even if multiple seem relevant. Choose the most applicable one.

---

## Broad vs. Specific Traits

Traits can be **Broad** or **Specific**. The scope affects WHEN they apply, not the mechanical bonus.

### Broad Traits

Apply to many situations, but might be less evocative.

**Examples:**
- Athletics
- Combat
- Social
- Technology
- Stealth
- Investigation

**Pros:** Come up frequently, versatile
**Cons:** Less narrative flavor, less unique

### Specific Traits

Apply to narrower situations, but create richer story hooks.

**Examples:**
- Expert Marksman (instead of "Combat")
- Cat Burglar (instead of "Stealth")
- Military Veteran (instead of "Combat")
- Street Racer (instead of "Driving")
- Forensic Pathologist (instead of "Investigation")

**Pros:** Memorable, suggest backstory, create narrative hooks
**Cons:** Come up less often

### The Sweet Spot

The best traits are **specific enough to be interesting, broad enough to be useful**.

- **Too Broad:** "Good at Things" (applies to everything, meaningless)
- **Too Specific:** "Can Pick Victorian-Era Padlocks While Blindfolded" (almost never comes up)
- **Just Right:** "Expert Lockpick" or "Trained in Covert Entry"

**Guideline:** Good balanced traits will be invoked between 5-7 times per session. If it comes up constantly, it might be too broad. If it never comes up, it's too narrow.

## Creating Good Traits

### 1. Start with the Fiction

Don't think mechanically first. Think about your character's life:
- What have they done for a living?
- What did they study or train in?
- What hobbies or passions do they have?
- What reputation precedes them?
- What culture or organization shaped them?

Once you have answers, turn them into traits.

**Example:** "My character was a military medic before becoming a mercenary."

That suggests:
- Combat Trained (Advanced) - from military service
- Field Medicine (Basic) - from medic training
- Iron Nerves (Basic) - from working under fire

### 2. Make It Evocative

Traits should paint a picture. They should make people at the table say "oh, cool!" or "I want to know more about that."

**Boring:** Shooting
**Better:** Marksman
**Best:** Sniper, Never Misses, Deadeye, Long-Range Specialist

**Boring:** Smart
**Better:** Scholar
**Best:** Ancient Historian, Forensic Analyst, Arcane Researcher

The more specific and evocative your trait, the more story hooks it creates. Your GM can introduce NPCs from your past, complications tied to your expertise, or challenges that test your specialty.

### 3. Think About Relationships

Some of the best traits imply connections to the world:

- **Organizations:** "Undercover Fed," "Guild Assassin," "Corporate Heir"
- **Reputations:** "Famous Detective," "Wanted Outlaw," "Legendary Duelist"
- **Mentors/Rivals:** "Trained by Master Chen," "Rival of the Crimson Hand"
- **Cultural Ties:** "Daughter of the Wastes," "City Guard Veteran," "Nomad Trader"

These traits not only add dice—they give the GM ammunition for creating personal stakes.

### 4. Vary Your Portfolio

Don't make all your traits the same type. A character with:
- Expert Swordsman (Advanced)
- Master Duelist (Master)
- Combat Veteran (Basic)
- Trained in Fencing (Basic)

...is one-note. They're VERY good at fighting, but have no other dimensions.

Compare that to:
- Expert Swordsman (Advanced)
- Noble-Born (Basic)
- Tactical Mind (Basic)
- Silver Tongue (Basic)

Now you have a character who's not just a fighter—they're a noble with social graces, tactical acumen, and a signature combat style. That's richer.

**Aim for diversity:** Combat, social, knowledge, technical, physical, sensory. Give the GM lots of ways to involve your character.

### 5. Consider Action Economy

In NullFrame, you're building dice pools. Traits that apply to your PRIMARY actions (the things you'll do most often) should generally be Advanced or Master tier.

Traits that apply to SECONDARY actions (things you do occasionally) can be Basic tier.

**Example Combat Character:**
- Close Combat Specialist (Advanced) - your bread and butter
- Intimidating Presence (Basic) - occasionally useful
- Urban Navigation (Basic) - situational but helpful

This ensures you're effective at your core role while having breadth.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Traits That Are Just Stats

**Bad:** "Strong" (that's what Might is for)
**Bad:** "Smart" (that's what Intellect is for)
**Bad:** "Fast" (that's what Agility is for)

Traits should represent TRAINING, KNOWLEDGE, or BACKGROUND, not raw attributes.

**Good:** "I used to be an Olympic Wrestler" (training in using Might)
**Good:** "I finished my Engineering Degree" (knowledge using Intellect)

### 2. Boring Traits That Are Always On

**Bad:** "Lucky" (when does this NOT apply?)
**Bad:** "Determined" (too vague, always relevant)
**Bad:** "Competent" (meaningless)

If a trait applies to EVERY roll, it's not a trait.

### 3. Traits That Are Really Flaws

Remember: **Traits ONLY help. They never hinder.**

**Bad:** "Hotheaded" (this creates problems—it's a Flaw)
**Bad:** "Overconfident" (this is a Flaw)
**Bad:** "Haunted by the Past" (this is a Flaw)

If it complicates your life, it's a Flaw. Traits are competencies, not complications.

### 4. Trait Names That Don't Say Anything

**Bad:** "Background #1"
**Bad:** "Training"
**Bad:** "Skill"

Traits should be flavorful and specific. They're on your character sheet for the whole campaign—make them sing.

---

## Trait + Flaw Pairs

The Rule of Balance means every Trait has a corresponding Flaw. You don't have to link them explicitly, but sometimes it makes sense to create pairs:

**Trait:** Military Veteran (Advanced)
**Flaw:** PTSD from the War (Moderate penalty in high-stress combat)

**Trait:** Master Hacker (Master)
**Flaw:** Wanted by Megacorp Security (narrative complication)

**Trait:** Noble-Born (Basic)
**Flaw:** Obligation to the Family (narrative burden)

This creates rich characters—your strengths come with costs, your expertise comes with history.

---

## Examples: Good vs. Better vs. Best

### Example 1: The Fighter

**Good:** Combat
**Better:** Swordsman
**Best:** Bladesmaster of the Northern School

### Example 2: The Hacker

**Good:** Technology
**Better:** Hacker
**Best:** Ghost in the Net, Corporate Security Cracker, Code Breaker

### Example 3: The Investigator

**Good:** Investigation
**Better:** Detective
**Best:** Forensic Specialist, Reads Crime Scenes Like Books, Private Eye with a Nose for Lies

### Example 4: The Pilot

**Good:** Driving
**Better:** Pilot
**Best:** Ace Starfighter Pilot, Flown Everything That Flies, Smuggler's Route Expert

---

## Trait Collaboration

**Work with your GM and table when creating traits.**

When you write down a trait, you're not just claiming a mechanical bonus—you're introducing facts about the world:

- "Guild Assassin" suggests a Guild exists
- "Trained by Master Chen" suggests Master Chen exists (and might appear in-game)
- "Wanted Outlaw" suggests you have a criminal past the GM can exploit

The GM should ask questions:
- "What's the Guild like?"
- "Tell me about Master Chen—friend or foe now?"
- "What did you do to get that bounty?"

Your answers create the world together.

---

## Starting Traits

Most starting characters have **3-5 Traits** (and therefore 3-5 Flaws):
- 1-2 Advanced traits (your specialties)
- 2-3 Basic traits (your breadth)

---

## Advancing Traits

You can improve traits through advancement:
- **Basic → Advanced:** Costs advancement points
- **Advanced → Master:** Costs more advancement points
- **New Basic Trait:** Costs advancement points + requires new Flaw

See **Progression** for details.

---

## GM Guidance: When Traits Apply

As GM, be generous with trait applicability. If a player makes a reasonable case for why their trait helps, let them use it.

**Player:** "I want to use my 'Military Veteran' trait to organize the villagers into a defensive formation."
**GM:** "Absolutely. That makes perfect sense. Add your dice."

The only time to say no is when the trait genuinely doesn't apply:

**Player:** "I want to use my 'Expert Hacker' trait to punch this guy."
**GM:** "How does hacking help you punch?"
**Player:** "Uh... never mind."

When in doubt, ask the player to justify it in the fiction. If they can sell it narratively, allow it mechanically.

---

## Trait Template

When creating a new trait, ask yourself:

1. **What does this trait represent?** (background, training, reputation, skill)
2. **When does it apply?** (give 2-3 example situations)
3. **What tier is it?** (Basic, Advanced, Master)
4. **What story hooks does it create?** (relationships, obligations, complications)
5. **What's the matching Flaw?** (remember the Rule of Balance)

If you can answer all five, you have a good trait.

## Final Thought

**Traits are love letters to the GM.**

Every trait you write is a request: "I want this to matter in the story. I want scenes where this expertise is tested. I want NPCs who care about this background. I want my character's history to create drama."

The more evocative and specific your traits, the more ammunition you give your GM to make the game personal.

So make them count. Make them sing. Make them matter.

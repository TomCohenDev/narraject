# What Is Narraject?

Narraject is a tabletop roleplaying game about **identity under pressure**.

You'll roll dice to see if you succeed. But more importantly, you'll roll *your* die—the one that represents who you are—to see if you succeed *as yourself*.

## The Elevator Pitch

Imagine a sniper taking an impossible shot. In most games, you roll, you hit or miss, you move on.

In Narraject, you roll your dice pool and count your successes. But then you look at your **Step Die**—the die that represents "Master Sniper." 

If it's your highest die, you didn't just hit the target. You hit it *like a master sniper*. You describe the moment. You earn narrative currency to spend later.

If it's your lowest die, you still hit—but you got lucky. The wind shifted at the last second. You succeeded *despite* your training, not because of it. The GM earns currency to complicate things later.

And if your Step Die betrays you completely—showing a 1 or 2—something goes wrong. Not because you failed, but because leaning into your identity always carries risk.

**That's Narraject.** A game where your character's signature trait is mechanically central, not just flavor text.

## Core Concepts

### The Dice Pool
When you attempt something risky, you roll a pool of six-sided dice (d6s). The more dice, the better your odds. You build this pool from your stats, traits, gear, and circumstances.

### The Step Die
In addition to your d6s, you add **one** special die—your Step Die. This die can be a d6, d8, d10, or d12, depending on how developed your signature trait is.

The Step Die doesn't just add to your pool. It's the **star of the show**. Its performance tells you whether you succeeded with style, scraped by on luck, or exposed yourself to trouble.

### Hits and Success
Count the dice showing **5 or 6**. Each one is a **Hit**. Compare your Hits to the difficulty (typically 1-5). Meet or exceed the difficulty, and you succeed.

### Injector Points (IPs)
IPs are currency for narrative control. You earn them by accepting complications. You spend them to inject facts, assets, and twists into the story.

The GM has IPs too. The economy flows both ways.

### Narrative Injection
This is the game's core hook. At any moment, you can spend IPs to **inject** something into the scene:
- "There's a fire escape on this building."
- "This guard served in my old unit."
- "I brought a grappling hook, actually."

You're not asking the GM if these things are true. You're *making* them true—within reason, and within your budget.

## The Flow of Play

1. **The GM sets the scene.** What's happening? What's at stake?
2. **Players declare actions.** What are you trying to do?
3. **Roll dice when it matters.** Build your pool, roll, count Hits.
4. **Read the Step Die.** Did you define the moment, or did luck carry you?
5. **The GM narrates the outcome.** Success, failure, or something in between.
6. **IPs change hands.** Complications accepted, injections spent.
7. **Repeat.**

## What Kind of Stories?

Narraject is **setting-agnostic**. The core mechanics work for:

- **Cyberpunk:** Hackers, mercenaries, corporate espionage
- **Fantasy:** Swords, sorcery, dungeon delving
- **Sci-Fi:** Starships, alien contact, space horror
- **Modern:** Spies, heists, supernatural investigation
- **Post-Apocalypse:** Survival, scavenging, community building

The GM section includes guidance for adapting the game to different genres.

## Design Philosophy

> **Narraject believes:**
>
> Your character's identity should matter mechanically, not just narratively.
>
> Complications should be *offered*, not imposed. You choose your drama.
>
> More dice feels better than bigger modifiers.
>
> The GM's job is hard enough. The system should make it easier.
>
> Every roll should tell a story, even if it's just "I got lucky."

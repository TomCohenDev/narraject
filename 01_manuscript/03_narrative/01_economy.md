# The Narrative Economy

Narraject isn't a game where the GM tells a story and players react. It's a negotiation. Both sides have currency. Both sides spend it.

That currency is **Injector Points (IPs)**.

---

## What Are IPs?

IPs represent narrative authority—your ability to shape the story beyond what the dice determine.

When you have IPs, you can:
- Inject facts into the fiction
- Refuse complications the GM offers
- Push your luck after a roll

When the GM has IPs, they can:
- Introduce obstacles and twists
- Activate NPC special abilities
- Raise the stakes

The economy flows. You earn IPs by accepting trouble. You spend them to create advantage. The GM earns IPs when your Step Die betrays you. They spend them to make the story harder.

---

## Starting IPs

- **Players** begin each session with **2 IPs**
- **The GM** begins with IPs equal to **2 × number of players**

Unspent IPs carry over between sessions:
- Player cap: **5 IPs**
- GM cap: **10 IPs**

---

## Using Tokens

Use physical tokens—poker chips, coins, glass beads. Place them visibly on the table.

Why? Because seeing the economy changes how you play.

When the GM's pile is low, you know you have room to push. When it's high, you know complications are coming. When your pile is empty, you know accepting that next intrusion might be smart.

Visible resources create informed decisions.

## How Players Earn IPs

| Source | IPs Earned | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Accept a GM Intrusion** | +2 | Must give 1 to another player |
| **Step Die is Highest** | +1 | Your identity defined the moment |
| **Advance a Story Goal** | +1 | Completing a personal arc beat (GM discretion) |
| **Exceptional Roleplay** | +1 | Sparingly—don't overuse this |

### The "Give 1 Away" Rule

When you accept a GM Intrusion, you receive 2 IPs but **must give 1 to another player**.

State why:
- *"I give this to Marcus—my screw-up makes his job harder."*
- *"Yara gets this because she's going to need it for that hacking roll."*

This creates table awareness. You're watching each other's IP pools. You're rooting for each other to accept complications because it feeds the party.

---

## GM Intrusions

This is borrowed from the Cypher System—and it's one of the best mechanics in tabletop gaming.

### What They Are

A GM Intrusion is a complication the GM introduces. Not a punishment—an *offer*.

The GM describes something bad happening or about to happen. They offer you 2 IPs to accept it. You choose.

### The Flow

```
1. GM: "The lock clicks open, but you hear footsteps behind you. 
       Guards. I'm offering an Intrusion—2 IPs if you accept."

2. Player chooses:
   → ACCEPT: "I'll take it." Keep 1 IP, give 1 to another player.
              The guards are real. Deal with them.
   
   → REFUSE: "I'll spend 1 IP to refuse." 
              The guards aren't there. Retcon. You proceed cleanly.
```

### When to Refuse

You can only refuse if you have at least 1 IP.

Refusing isn't "cheating" the story—it's spending your narrative currency. You earned those IPs. Spend them how you want.

But remember: refusing costs 1, while accepting nets you 2 (1 for you, 1 for an ally). Mathematically, accepting is usually smarter. The question is whether *this* complication is worth accepting.

### Good Intrusions

**Do:**
- Complicate success: *"You hit him, but your sword gets stuck in his armor."*
- Create choices: *"The door's open, but you can only save one hostage before the bomb goes off."*
- Introduce new problems: *"You succeeded, but someone was watching."*
- Allow reaction: *"You hear footsteps approaching. What do you do?"*

**Don't:**
- Negate success: *"Actually, you missed."*
- Remove agency: *"Your character panics and runs."*
- Punish smart play: *"Because you prepared, the enemy prepared more."*
- Make the PC look incompetent: *"You trip over your own feet."*

### Intrusion Frequency

Target: **1 per player per session**, plus any triggered by rules (see below).

Too few intrusions → Economy stagnates, players hoard IPs.  
Too many intrusions → Players feel picked on, refuse everything.

### Free Intrusions (No Choice)

Sometimes the GM gets complications without offering IPs:

| Trigger | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Step Die shows 1-2** | GM gets one complication |
| **Zero Hits on a roll** | GM gets one complication |
| **Established fiction demands it** | No roll needed (you're underwater, you're drowning) |

Free intrusions aren't negotiations. They happen because the dice—or the situation—demand it.

---

## Player Injections

If intrusions are how trouble enters the story, **injections** are how players edit it.

### What They Are

A Narrative Injection is a player-initiated fact, asset, or twist inserted into the fiction.

Not: *"I attack him."* (That's a normal action.)

Instead: *"There's a fire escape on this building."* Or: *"This guard served in my old unit."* Or: *"I actually brought a grappling hook."*

You're not asking the GM if it's true. You're spending IPs to *make* it true.

### The Injection Menu

| IP Cost | What You Can Inject |
|---------|---------------------|
| **1 IP** | A sensory detail or environmental flavor |
| **2 IP** | A minor fact—a useful object, an NPC's mood |
| **3 IP** | A relationship or useful knowledge |
| **4 IP** | A significant tactical advantage |
| **5 IP** | A major story connection |

**Examples:**

| Cost | Example |
|------|---------|
| 1 | "The hallway smells like antiseptic—hospital, not office." |
| 2 | "There's a service entrance behind the dumpsters." |
| 3 | "I trained with this guard's unit. We're not friends, but there's respect." |
| 4 | "The security system has a five-second window during shift change." |
| 5 | "This facility is owned by my father's company. I recognize the logo." |

### GM Response

The GM can:
- **Accept:** It's exactly as you described.
- **Yes, But:** Accept with a complication. *"Your contact is here, but he owes money to the wrong people."*
- **Counteroffer:** Modify the injection. *"Not a fire escape, but there's a drainpipe."*
- **Refuse:** Only if it contradicts established fiction or breaks genre.

Refusals should be rare. If you're refusing often, the player is probably low on IPs anyway—let them have their moment.

### When to Inject

- Before a roll (to improve your situation)
- After a roll (to explain success or mitigate failure)
- Between scenes (to establish facts for later)
- During GM narration (interrupt politely)

---

## The GM's IPs

The GM has an IP pool too. Symmetry matters.

### How the GM Earns IPs

| Source | IPs Earned |
|--------|------------|
| **Step Die is lowest** | +1 IP |
| **Free intrusion (1-2 or 0 Hits)** | +0 (complication, not IPs) |
| **Session start** | Reset to 2 × players if below |

### How the GM Spends IPs

| Cost | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **1 IP** | Minor complication without offering compensation |
| **2 IP** | Activate an NPC's special ability |
| **3 IP** | Introduce an unexpected enemy or obstacle |
| **4 IP** | Reveal a hidden connection or betrayal |
| **5 IP** | Dramatically change the stakes of a scene |

### Limits

- The GM **cannot** spend IPs to negate player Injections
- The GM **must** announce IP spending before players roll
- No "gotcha" moments—the economy is visible

## Economy Health

At session's end, assess:

**Healthy signs:**
- IPs changed hands often
- Players accepted most intrusions
- Players made meaningful injections
- GM pile fluctuated

**Warning signs:**
- Players refused every intrusion (too harsh?)
- Players hoarded IPs (nothing worth buying?)
- One player has 5, others have 0 (redistribution failing?)
- GM never spent IPs (not engaging the economy)

Adjust accordingly. The economy should *flow*.

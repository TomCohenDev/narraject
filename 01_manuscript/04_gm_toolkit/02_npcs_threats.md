# NPCs and Threats

NPCs need minimal stats. Following Cypher's lead: one number tells you everything.

## The Level System

**Level** determines:

- Marks needed to affect them (usually Level = Difficulty)
- Threat they pose (Level = Marks needed to inflict Conditions)
- Reserve capacity (if tracked)

Most NPCs have 1-3 Conditions before they're out. Bosses might have more.

## NPC Stat Blocks

Keep it simple:

```
GANG ENFORCER
Level: 3
Motivation: Protect the boss
Special: Pack tactics (+1d6 with allies)
```

That's it. You have everything you need.

## Building NPCs

**Level 1-2:** Mooks, minions, obstacles
- Easy to affect (1-2 Marks)
- Low threat (1-2 Marks to inflict Conditions)
- 1 Condition before they're out

**Level 3-4:** Named NPCs, lieutenants
- Moderate challenge (3-4 Marks)
- Real threat (3-4 Marks to inflict Conditions)
- 2-3 Conditions before they're out

**Level 5-6:** Bosses, major threats
- Hard challenge (5-6 Marks)
- Serious threat (5-6 Marks to inflict Conditions)
- 3-5 Conditions before they're out

**Level 7+:** Legendary threats, endgame bosses
- Heroic challenge (7+ Marks)
- Extreme threat (7+ Marks to inflict Conditions)
- 5+ Conditions before they're out

## Special Abilities

Give NPCs **Specials**—one-sentence abilities:

- **Pack tactics:** +1d6 with allies
- **Armored:** Reduce Condition severity by 1 level
- **Fast:** Can move between zones as a free action
- **Tough:** Requires one extra Condition to take out
- **Cunning:** Once per scene, force a reroll

Keep it simple. One special per NPC is usually enough.

---

## Motivations

Every NPC should have a **Motivation**—one sentence about what they want:

- "Protect the boss"
- "Get rich quick"
- "Prove I'm the best"
- "Survive at any cost"

Use motivations to drive NPC behavior. They want something. How does that create conflict?

## Threats Beyond Combat

Not all threats are combat. Use the same system:

**Social Threat:**
- Level determines Difficulty to persuade/intimidate
- "Defeat" means they concede, agree, or back down

**Environmental Threat:**
- Level determines Difficulty to overcome
- "Defeat" means you survive, escape, or solve it

**Mystery Threat:**
- Level determines Difficulty to solve
- "Defeat" means you uncover the truth

Same system, different stakes.

| Level | Difficulty | Threat | Conditions |

| 3-4   | Challenging-Hard | Moderate | 2-3 |

Keep it simple. One number tells you everything.

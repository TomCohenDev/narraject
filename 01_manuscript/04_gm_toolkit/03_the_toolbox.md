# The Toolbox

This is your "Extension Cord." Instead of writing a "Setting" chapter, you write a Toolbox chapter. This is how you allow for future expansions.

These are **modular rules** you can add to the core game without breaking it. Mix and match as needed.

---

## Magic

**To add magic, allow Traits to have the [Supernatural] tag. Costs 1 IP to activate.**

**Basic Magic:**

- Trait: [Supernatural] Fire Magic (Advanced, +2d6)
- Cost: 1 IP per use
- Effect: Add +2d6 to relevant rolls, or create narrative effects

**Advanced Magic:**

- Create Focus abilities that grant supernatural powers
- Use Step Die for magical effects (d8/d10/d12 based on mastery)
- IP costs scale with power level (1-3 IPs)

**Example Focus:** "Bears a Halo of Fire"

- Tier 1: Ignite (create fire, 1 IP)
- Tier 2: Fireball (area attack, 2 IPs)
- Tier 3: Inferno (major environmental effect, 3 IPs)

---

## Vehicles

**Treat vehicles as a second Character Sheet with only Physical stats.**

**Vehicle Stats:**

- Might: Durability, ramming power
- Agility: Speed, maneuverability
- Intellect: Systems, autopilot (if applicable)
- Persona: N/A (vehicles don't have social stats)

**Vehicle Conditions:**

- Hurt: -1d6 to all vehicle actions
- Wounded: -2d6, systems failing
- Critical: -3d6, vehicle disabled

**Vehicle Actions:**

- Use standard action resolution
- Driver's Agility Rating applies
- Vehicle's Agility Rating adds dice
- Gear (weapons, armor) works as normal

**Example:** A sports car might have Agility Rating 4, Quality handling (+2d6), and Light armor (reduce Condition by 1 level).

---

## Horror

**Add a 'Panic Die' to the pool (Mothership style).**

**Panic System:**

- When facing horror/threat, add a d6 Panic Die to every roll
- If Panic Die shows 1-2, character panics (GM describes effect)
- Panic effects: freeze, flee, drop items, etc.
- Can spend 1 IP to ignore panic for one roll

**Sanity Conditions:**

- Instead of physical Conditions, track mental Conditions
- Shaken (-1d6), Terrified (-2d6), Broken (-3d6)
- Recovery requires safety, rest, or therapy

**Horror Injections:**

- GM can spend IPs to trigger panic
- Environmental horror (darkness, isolation) adds Difficulty
- Unknown threats have higher Difficulty (fear of the unknown)

---

## Cyberware / Augmentations

**Treat cyberware as Gear with [Augmented] tag.**

**Basic Augmentations:**

- Standard: +1d6 to relevant rolls
- Quality: +2d6 to relevant rolls
- Masterwork: +3d6 to relevant rolls

**Advanced Augmentations:**

- Create Focus abilities that require cyberware
- Use Step Die for augmented abilities (d8/d10/d12 based on quality)
- IP costs for special abilities (1-2 IPs)

**Example:** "Neural Interface" (Quality, +2d6 to hacking, can spend 1 IP to directly interface with systems)

---

## Stealth / Infiltration

**Add a 'Detection Die' to stealth rolls.**

**Detection System:**

- When sneaking, add a d6 Detection Die to every roll
- If Detection Die shows 1-2, you're detected (GM describes how)
- Can spend 1 IP to ignore detection for one roll
- Higher security = higher Difficulty

**Infiltration Zones:**

- Public: Easy to move, low security
- Restricted: Moderate security, requires credentials
- Secure: Hard security, requires special access
- Maximum: Very Hard security, nearly impossible

---

## Social Intrigue

**Track Relationship Levels with NPCs.**

**Relationship Levels:**

- Hostile: -1d6 to social rolls
- Neutral: No modifier
- Friendly: +1d6 to social rolls
- Ally: +2d6 to social rolls

**Social Conditions:**

- Disgraced (-1d6 to social rolls)
- Shunned (-2d6 to social rolls)
- Exiled (-3d6 to social rolls, may trigger other consequences)

**Reputation:**

- Track reputation with factions
- High reputation: +1d6 to relevant rolls, access to resources
- Low reputation: -1d6 to relevant rolls, denied access

---

## Crafting / Building

**Use extended actions with progress tracks.**

**Crafting System:**

- Set Difficulty based on item complexity
- Track progress: each success adds 1 progress point
- Required progress = Difficulty × 2
- Can work over multiple sessions (downtime activity)

**Example:** Building a quality weapon requires 8 progress points (Hard = 4 Successes, × 2 = 8 progress). Each successful crafting roll adds 1 progress.

## How to Use This Toolbox

1. **Pick what fits your game.** Don't add everything—just what you need.

2. **Test in play.** Modular rules should feel natural. If they don't, adjust or remove them.

3. **Combine as needed.** Magic + Vehicles? Horror + Cyberware? Mix and match.

4. **Create your own.** These are examples. Build what your game needs.

---

## Future Expansions

Because you structured the Toolbox this way, you can release expansions later without rewriting the book.

**Future Expansion 1:** "Run By Null: Neon Streets" (Adds Cyberware rules to the Toolbox)

**Future Expansion 2:** "Run By Null: Iron Kingdoms" (Adds Castle Management to the Toolbox)

**Future Expansion 3:** "Run By Null: Cosmic Horror" (Adds expanded Horror rules to the Toolbox)

The core game remains 50 pages. The expansions just plug into the Toolbox.

## Creating New Modular Rules

When creating new modular rules:

1. **Keep it simple.** One mechanic, one page max.

2. **Don't break the core.** Modular rules should enhance, not replace, the core loop.

3. **Use existing systems.** Build on Ratings, Reserves, Conditions, IPs.

4. **Test in play.** Modular rules need playtesting too.

5. **Document clearly.** Future you (and other GMs) will thank you.

The Toolbox is your playground. Use it wisely.

# GM Principles

Running Narraject is about facilitating play, not controlling the story. These principles guide you.

## When to Roll

Roll when:

- The outcome is uncertain
- Failure has consequences
- Success isn't trivial

Don't roll when:

- The task is routine
- There's no time pressure or opposition
- Failure would just mean "roll again"

> **Golden Rule:** If failure wouldn't be interesting, don't call for a roll. Just say yes.

## Setting Difficulty

The GM determines how many **Marks** you need. A Mark is any die showing 5 or higher.

| Marks Needed | Difficulty  | Example                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | Trivial     | Routine task, no roll needed                             |
| 1            | Easy        | Climb a ladder, spot an obvious clue                     |
| 2            | Moderate    | Pick a simple lock, persuade a neutral stranger          |
| 3            | Challenging | Hit a moving target, hack a secured system               |
| 4            | Hard        | Scale a sheer wall in rain, convince a hostile NPC       |
| 5-6          | Very Hard   | Near-impossible shot, walk on fire, sway a hostile crowd |
| 7-8          | Heroic      | Feats that define legends, impossible odds               |
| 9-10         | Legendary   | Nearly impossible, once-in-a-lifetime achievements       |
| 10+          | Mythic      | Feats of gods and demigods                               |

The GM may state the exact number ("That's 4 Marks") or describe it ("That's very hard"). Both work.

## The Golden Rule: Success = Intent

**If you succeed on the roll, your Intent happens. Period.**

When a player declares intent, set the Difficulty that matches the ambition.

**Don't say:** "You can't kill a dragon with a fork."

**Do say:** "That's Legendary—10 Marks. If you succeed, the fork pierces its eye and kills it instantly."

The player can then decide: do I want to try for 10 Marks, or do I want to aim for something more achievable?

---

## Adjudicating Actions

1. **Listen to the intent.** What does the player want to achieve?
2. **Determine the stat.** Which stat applies based on the approach?
3. **Set the difficulty.** How ambitious is the intent?
4. **Let them roll.** Don't gatekeep—let the dice decide.
5. **Narrate the outcome.** Success means the intent happens. Failure means it doesn't.

## Using GM Intrusions

Target: **1 per player per session**, plus any triggered by rules.

**Good Intrusions:**
- Complicate success
- Create choices
- Introduce new problems
- Allow reaction

**Bad Intrusions:**
- Negate success
- Remove agency
- Punish smart play
- Make the PC look incompetent

---

## Managing the IP Economy

**Healthy signs:**
- IPs changed hands often
- Players accepted most intrusions
- Players made meaningful injections
- GM pile fluctuated

**Warning signs:**
- Players refused every intrusion (too harsh?)
- Players hoarded IPs (nothing worth buying?)
- One player has 5, others have 0 (redistribution failing?)
- GM never spent IPs (not engaging the economy)

Adjust accordingly. The economy should _flow_.

---

## Improvisation

Narraject is designed for improvisation. You don't need to prep everything.

**Single-number NPCs:** Level determines everything (Difficulty to affect, threat they pose).

**Yes, and / Yes, but:** Build on player ideas. Say yes when you can, add complications when you can't.

**Trust the table:** Players will help you create the story. Let them.

---

## Safety Tools

Use safety tools. They make the game better for everyone.

- **Lines and Veils:** Establish boundaries before play
- **X-card:** Stop the game if something is uncomfortable
- **Check in:** Ask how everyone is doing, especially after intense scenes

The goal is fun for everyone. Safety tools ensure that.

## Your Job

Your job is to:

- Set the scene
- Adjudicate actions
- Manage the IP economy
- Facilitate fun

Your job is **not** to:

- Control the story
- "Win" against the players
- Gatekeep actions
- Punish players

Trust the system. Trust the table. Have fun.

curr# Pacing: Scenes vs Downtime

Narraject alternates between **Scenes** (action, risk, rolls) and **Downtime** (recovery, planning, roleplay).

---

## Scenes

A **Scene** is a discrete unit of action with clear stakes.

**When to start a Scene:**

- Something is happening
- There's conflict or risk
- Players want to act

**When to end a Scene:**

- The immediate conflict is resolved
- The stakes have changed
- The table needs a break

Scenes can be combat, social encounters, exploration, investigation—anything with risk and uncertainty.

---

## Downtime

**Downtime** is the space between Scenes. This is when you:

- Recover Reserve (1 point per stat per 10 minutes)
- Remove Conditions (requires rest or medical care)
- Plan next moves
- Roleplay character moments
- Spend IPs on Injections (establishing facts for later)

Downtime doesn't need rolls unless something risky happens. It's breathing room.

## Scene Structure

1. **GM sets the scene.** What's happening? What's at stake?
2. **Players declare actions.** What are you trying to do?
3. **Roll dice when it matters.** Build your pool, roll, count Successes.
4. **Read the Step Die.** Did you define the moment, or did luck carry you?
5. **The GM narrates the outcome.** Success, failure, or something in between.
6. **IPs change hands.** Complications accepted, injections spent.
7. **Repeat or transition to Downtime.**

## Pacing Guidelines

**Fast Pacing:**

- Multiple short Scenes
- Quick transitions
- High action, low downtime

**Slow Pacing:**

- Fewer, longer Scenes
- Extended Downtime
- More roleplay, less action

**Balanced Pacing:**

- Mix of Scene types
- Regular Downtime breaks
- Action and roleplay in balance

The table decides. Adjust based on what's fun.

## Session Structure

A typical 3-4 hour session:

1. **Opening Scene** (15-30 min) — Establish the situation
2. **Main Scenes** (2-3 hours) — The meat of the session
3. **Climax Scene** (30-60 min) — Big stakes, big rolls
4. **Downtime/Epilogue** (15-30 min) — Recovery, planning, advancement

Not every session needs this structure. Some sessions are all action. Some are all planning. Trust the table.

---

## Transitions

**Scene → Downtime:**

- "The guards are dealt with. You have a moment to breathe. What do you do?"

**Downtime → Scene:**

- "As you're planning, you hear footsteps. Someone's coming."

**Scene → Scene:**

- "The door opens. Inside, you see..."

Keep transitions clear. Don't leave players wondering what's happening.

## Recovery During Scenes

You can't fully recover during a Scene. Short rests (10 minutes) recover 1 point per stat, but you're still in danger.

Full recovery requires Downtime or a Long Rest (full night's sleep).

Conditions require separate recovery (see Consequences).

# Consequences: Conditions

Instead of hit points, characters have **Conditions**. Damage is separate from your stat Reserves.

## The Three Conditions

| Condition    | Effect                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Hurt**     | -1d6 to all actions                      |
| **Wounded**  | -2d6 to all actions                      |
| **Critical** | -3d6 to all actions, death spiral begins |

You can have multiple Conditions. They stack.

**Example:** If you're Hurt (-1d6) and then become Wounded (-2d6), you're at -3d6 total. If you become Critical (-3d6) on top of that, you're at -6d6. That's bad.

## Taking Conditions

When you succeed on an attack, you inflict a Condition based on your intent and the excess Marks:

| Intent / Result        | Condition Inflicted |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| "I want to hurt them"  | Hurt (1 Mark)       |
| "I want to wound them" | Wounded (2 Marks)   |
| "I want to kill them"  | Critical (3 Marks)  |

**Excess Marks** can upgrade the Condition:

- Base intent achieved + 1-2 excess Marks = One Condition worse
- Base intent achieved + 3+ excess Marks = Two Conditions worse

**Example:** You declare "I want to hurt the bandit" (1 Mark needed). You roll 4 Marks. You inflicted Hurt, but the 3 excess Marks upgrade it to Wounded.

## Armor

Armor doesn't add dice. Instead, it **reduces Condition severity**.

| Armor Type | Effect                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Light      | Reduce Condition by 1 level  |
| Medium     | Reduce Condition by 2 levels |
| Heavy      | Reduce Condition by 3 levels |

**Example:** You take a hit that would inflict Wounded. You're wearing Medium armor. You become Hurt instead.

Armor can't reduce below Hurt. Even in full plate, a solid hit still hurts.

---

## Recovery

Conditions don't heal automatically. You need:

- **Rest:** A full night's sleep removes one Condition
- **Medical Care:** A successful Mind roll (Difficulty 2-4) removes one Condition
- **Time:** A week of rest removes all Conditions

> **GM Tip:** Don't let Conditions linger forever. Recovery should be achievable, but not trivial.

---

## Death and Dying

When you reach **Critical**, you're in the death spiral. Each additional Condition pushes you closer to death.

**At Critical + Hurt:** You're barely conscious. You can only take simple actions.

**At Critical + Wounded:** You're dying. Make a Might roll (Difficulty 3) each round or fall unconscious.

**At Critical + Critical:** You're dead. Unless someone intervenes with medical care or magic.

> **GM Tip:** Death should be rare. Most combats end when someone is Wounded or Critical. Let players surrender, flee, or be captured.

---

## Non-Combat Consequences

Conditions aren't just for combat. They can represent:

- **Stress:** Mental exhaustion from constant pressure
- **Exhaustion:** Physical depletion from overexertion
- **Illness:** Sickness, poison, disease
- **Injury:** Non-combat accidents, falls, environmental hazards

The GM can apply Conditions for narrative reasons, but should offer IPs if it's a GM Intrusion.

## Quick Reference

| Condition    | Effect                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Hurt**     | -1d6 to all actions               |
| **Wounded**  | -2d6 to all actions               |
| **Critical** | -3d6 to all actions, death spiral |

Conditions stack. Multiple Conditions = multiple penalties.

Armor reduces severity. Light = -1 level, Medium = -2, Heavy = -3.

Death spiral starts at Critical. Each additional Condition pushes you closer to death.

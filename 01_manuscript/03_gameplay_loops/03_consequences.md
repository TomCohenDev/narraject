# Consequences: Conditions

Instead of hit points, characters have **Conditions**. Damage is separate from your stat Reserves.

---

## The Three Conditions

| Condition    | Effect                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Hurt**     | -1d6 to all actions                      |
| **Wounded**  | -2d6 to all actions                      |
| **Critical** | -3d6 to all actions, death spiral begins |

You can have multiple Conditions. They stack.

**Example:** If you're Hurt (-1d6) and then become Wounded (-2d6), you're at -3d6 total. If you become Critical (-3d6) on top of that, you're at -6d6. That's bad.

---

## Named Conditions

When you take a Condition, **you name it**. The mechanical tier stays the same, but the narrative flavor is yours.

**Example:** You take a Wounded Condition. Instead of just "Wounded," you describe it as:

- "Broken Ribs" (physical)
- "Can't Trust Anyone" (social)
- "Leg Pinned Under Rubble" (environmental)
- "Rattled" (mental)

The mechanical effect is still -2d6. But now it has a story.

### Why Name Conditions?

Named Conditions do three things:

1. **They're memorable.** "Broken Ribs" sticks in your mind better than "Wounded #2."
2. **They guide recovery.** A named Condition suggests how it might heal—or worsen.
3. **They're exploitable.** The GM can spend IP to make your specific injury matter.

> **Design Note:** This mechanic is inspired by City of Mist and Fate, where injuries have narrative weight beyond their mechanical penalties. Your "Broken Ribs" might not just be -2d6—it might mean you can't climb that wall, period.

---

## Exploiting Conditions

Your Conditions aren't just penalties. They're narrative hooks the GM can pull.

### GM Exploitation

The GM can spend **1 IP** to exploit one of your named Conditions. When exploited, the Condition's narrative becomes mechanically relevant:

- **Add +1d6 to an enemy's roll** against you (they target your weakness)
- **Force a reroll** on one of your actions (your Condition interferes)
- **Impose a narrative restriction** (you can't do X because of your Condition)

**Example:** You have "Broken Ribs" (Wounded). The GM spends 1 IP. Now the enemy's next attack gets +1d6 because they're targeting your injured side. Or the GM says: "You can't climb that wall—your ribs won't let you breathe properly."

### Player Agency

You can't refuse exploitation—the GM spent IP. But you can **spend 1 IP** to mitigate it:

- Reduce the enemy's bonus from +1d6 to nothing
- Ignore the narrative restriction for one action
- Turn the exploitation into a different complication

**Example:** The GM exploits your "Broken Ribs" to add +1d6 to an enemy attack. You spend 1 IP. The bonus is gone—you grit your teeth and power through.

> **Design Note:** This creates a back-and-forth economy. The GM invests IP to make your injuries matter. You can invest IP to push back. Both sides are spending currency, which keeps the economy flowing.

---

## The Critical Comeback

When you're at **Critical**, you're in the death spiral. But sometimes, being beaten down makes you stronger.

### Desperation Bonus

While you have a **Critical** Condition, you gain a **Desperation Bonus**:

- **+1d6 to one action per scene** when you're acting from desperation
- You must narrate how your dire situation fuels this effort
- The bonus applies to the roll, but doesn't remove the -3d6 penalty

**Example:** You're Critical with "Bleeding Out." You need to reach the medkit across the room. You declare: "I drag myself forward, ignoring the pain—I have to survive." You get +1d6 to your Agility roll, but you're still at -3d6 total.

### When to Use It

The Desperation Bonus isn't automatic. You choose when to invoke it. It represents that moment when a hero finds strength in their lowest point.

**Good uses:**

- Saving an ally
- Reaching a critical objective
- One last attempt before going down

**Not for:**

- Routine actions
- Actions that don't matter
- Actions that aren't desperate

> **Design Note:** This mechanizes the "wounded hero comeback" trope from 7th Sea and Nobilis. You're not just penalized—you're also given a tool to push through when it matters most. But it's limited (once per scene) so it doesn't trivialize Critical Conditions.

---

## Taking Conditions

When you succeed on an attack, you inflict a Condition based on your intent and the excess Successes:

| Intent / Result        | Condition Inflicted    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| "I want to hurt them"  | Hurt (1 Success)       |
| "I want to wound them" | Wounded (2 Successes)  |
| "I want to kill them"  | Critical (3 Successes) |

**Excess Successes** can upgrade the Condition:

- Base intent achieved + 1-2 excess Successes = One Condition worse
- Base intent achieved + 3+ excess Successes = Two Conditions worse

**Example:** You declare "I want to hurt the bandit" (1 Success needed). You roll 4 Successes. You inflicted Hurt, but the 3 excess Successes upgrade it to Wounded.

---

## Armor

Armor doesn't add dice. Instead, it **reduces Condition severity**.

| Armor Type | Effect                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Light      | Reduce Condition by 1 level  |
| Medium     | Reduce Condition by 2 levels |
| Heavy      | Reduce Condition by 3 levels |

**Example:** You take a hit that would inflict Wounded. You're wearing Medium armor. You become Hurt instead.

Armor can't reduce below Hurt. Even in full plate, a solid hit still hurts.

---

## Recovery

Conditions don't heal automatically. You need:

- **Rest:** A full night's sleep removes one Condition
- **Medical Care:** A successful Intellect roll (Difficulty 2-4) removes one Condition
- **Time:** A week of rest removes all Conditions

> **GM Tip:** Don't let Conditions linger forever. Recovery should be achievable, but not trivial.

---

## Death and Dying

When you reach **Critical**, you're in the death spiral. Each additional Condition pushes you closer to death.

**At Critical + Hurt:** You're barely conscious. You can only take simple actions.

**At Critical + Wounded:** You're dying. Make a Might roll (Difficulty 3) each round or fall unconscious.

**At Critical + Critical:** You're dead. Unless someone intervenes with medical care or magic.

> **GM Tip:** Death should be rare. Most combats end when someone is Wounded or Critical. Let players surrender, flee, or be captured.

---

## Non-Combat Consequences

Conditions aren't just for combat. They can represent:

- **Stress:** Mental exhaustion from constant pressure
- **Exhaustion:** Physical depletion from overexertion
- **Illness:** Sickness, poison, disease
- **Injury:** Non-combat accidents, falls, environmental hazards

The GM can apply Conditions for narrative reasons, but should offer IPs if it's a GM Injection.

---

## Mental and Social Tracks

Physical Conditions aren't the only way you can be hurt. Sometimes, the damage is emotional or social.

### The Three Tracks

You have three separate Condition tracks:

| Track        | What It Represents                       | Examples                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical** | Bodily harm, injury, exhaustion          | "Broken Ribs," "Exhausted," "Poisoned"       |
| **Mental**   | Psychological stress, trauma, confusion  | "Rattled," "Paranoid," "Can't Focus"         |
| **Social**   | Reputation damage, trust loss, isolation | "Humiliated," "Can't Trust Anyone," "Exiled" |

Each track works independently. You can be physically fine but mentally shattered, or socially ruined but physically strong.

### How Tracks Work

Each track uses the same three tiers: **Hurt**, **Wounded**, **Critical**.

- **Physical Conditions** affect all actions (as normal)
- **Mental Conditions** affect Intellect and Persona actions
- **Social Conditions** affect Persona actions and social situations

**Example:** You have "Rattled" (Mental, Wounded). You take -2d6 to Intellect rolls (investigation, perception) and Persona rolls (willpower, composure). But your Might and Agility rolls are unaffected—your body is fine, your Intellect isn't.

### Taking Mental/Social Conditions

Mental and Social Conditions come from:

- **Failed social rolls:** You lose a debate, get publicly shamed, or fail to convince someone
- **GM Injections:** The GM offers a mental/social complication (with IP compensation)
- **Narrative events:** Betrayal, trauma, public failure, isolation
- **Enemy abilities:** Some threats target your Intellect or reputation directly

**Example:** You fail a Persona roll to convince the council. The GM offers: "You're publicly humiliated. Take 'Disgraced' (Social, Hurt) and gain 1 IP." You accept. Now you have -1d6 to all Persona actions.

### Recovery

Mental and Social Conditions recover differently:

- **Mental Conditions:** Require rest, therapy, or overcoming the source of stress
- **Social Conditions:** Require reputation repair, public apology, or time away from the situation

**Example:** Your "Can't Trust Anyone" (Mental, Wounded) might heal when you reconcile with a betrayed ally. Your "Humiliated" (Social, Hurt) might heal when you publicly redeem yourself.

> **Design Note:** This is inspired by Masks, which uses emotional conditions. It lets Face characters and social-focused builds have meaningful consequences that aren't just "you got punched." A character who's "Exiled" might be physically fine but narratively crippled.

---

## Combining Tracks

You can have Conditions on multiple tracks simultaneously.

**Example:** You're "Bleeding Out" (Physical, Critical), "Rattled" (Mental, Wounded), and "Disgraced" (Social, Hurt). You're in bad shape, but each track affects different things.

When an action could be affected by multiple Conditions, they stack.

**Example:** You're making a Persona roll to command troops. You have "Rattled" (Mental, Wounded, -2d6) and "Disgraced" (Social, Hurt, -1d6). You take -3d6 total to that roll.

## Quick Reference

| Condition    | Effect                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Hurt**     | -1d6 to all actions               |
| **Wounded**  | -2d6 to all actions               |
| **Critical** | -3d6 to all actions, death spiral |

Conditions stack. Multiple Conditions = multiple penalties.

**Name your Conditions.** "Broken Ribs" is more memorable than "Wounded #2."

**GM can exploit Conditions** by spending 1 IP to make the narrative matter mechanically.

**Critical gives Desperation Bonus:** +1d6 to one desperate action per scene.

**Three tracks:** Physical (all actions), Mental (Intellect/Persona), Social (Persona/social).

Armor reduces severity. Light = -1 level, Medium = -2, Heavy = -3.

Death spiral starts at Critical. Each additional Condition pushes you closer to death.

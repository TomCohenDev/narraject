# Conflicts and Enemies

_A GM's guide to building compelling opposition_

---

## Core Principle: The Threat Level

In Narraject, enemies don't roll dice. All dice rolls—whether attacking or defending—come from the players. This keeps the action focused on player agency while maintaining tension.

Every enemy has a **Threat Level** that serves as the difficulty for most actions against them:

- **Attacking an enemy:** Threat Level = difficulty to hit, overcome, or harm them
- **Defending against an enemy:** Threat Level = difficulty to dodge, resist, or block their attack
- **Other actions:** Threat Level = difficulty for most contested actions (intimidate them, track them, deceive them, etc.)

**Example:** A Threat Level 3 enemy requires 3 successes to hit, and players must roll 3 successes to dodge their attacks.

---

## Understanding the Numbers

Before building enemies, understand what players can achieve at different power levels. This table shows what difficulty is "fairly easy" (70-80% success) when optimized:

| Power Level | Fairly Easy | Stat Points | Typical Pool (Optimized) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1           | 1 mark      | 4-6         | 4-6d6                    |
| 2           | 2 marks     | 8-12        | 7-9d6                    |
| 3           | 3 marks     | 12-16       | 10-12d6                  |
| 4           | 4 marks     | 16-20       | 13-15d6                  |
| 5           | 5 marks     | 20-24       | 16-18d6                  |
| 6           | 6 marks     | 24-28       | 19-21d6                  |

**Key Insight:** Characters at Power Level 3 can reliably (70%+) overcome Threat Level 3 enemies when optimized. Higher threat levels create genuine challenges.

### Probability Reference

When players roll against a Threat Level, here are their approximate success chances:

| Pool Size | TL 1  | TL 2  | TL 3  | TL 4  | TL 5  | TL 6  |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 4d6       | 87%   | 59%   | 28%   | 9%    | 2%    | —     |
| 6d6       | 95%   | 79%   | 51%   | 26%   | 11%   | 3%    |
| 8d6       | 99%   | 91%   | 70%   | 44%   | 23%   | 10%   |
| 10d6      | ~100% | 96%   | 83%   | 61%   | 37%   | 20%   |
| 12d6      | ~100% | 99%   | 91%   | 74%   | 52%   | 32%   |
| 15d6      | ~100% | ~100% | 97%   | 87%   | 70%   | 50%   |

Use this to gauge how challenging a Threat Level will be for your players.

## Scaling Enemies to Your Campaign

### The Simple Method: Match Threat Level to Power Level

For a balanced encounter where players should succeed when prepared and optimized:

- **Threat Level = Party Power Level**
- Example: Power Level 3 party faces Threat Level 3 enemies

For different challenge levels:

- **Easy Fight:** Threat Level = Power Level - 1
- **Moderate Fight:** Threat Level = Power Level
- **Hard Fight:** Threat Level = Power Level + 1
- **Boss Fight:** Threat Level = Power Level + 2

**Example:** A Power Level 3 party:
- Easy fight: TL 2 bandits (70-80% success to hit)
- Moderate fight: TL 3 veteran soldiers (50-60% success to hit)
- Hard fight: TL 4 elite guards (30-40% success to hit)
- Boss fight: TL 5 master assassin (20-30% success to hit)

## Building Enemies: The Threat Profile

Every enemy needs:

### 1. Threat Level (Required)

The base difficulty for most actions against them.

**Threat Level Guidelines:**
- **TL 1:** Untrained civilians, frightened animals, basic obstacles
- **TL 2:** Trained professionals, competent threats
- **TL 3:** Veteran specialists, dangerous foes
- **TL 4:** Elite warriors, master criminals, formidable opponents
- **TL 5:** Legendary fighters, inhuman threats
- **TL 6+:** Mythical beings, world-class threats, campaign bosses

### 2. Stress Capacity (Required)

How much damage they can absorb before taking a Condition.

**Standard Capacity:** All characters and enemies start with **3 boxes** of Physical Stress and **3 boxes** of Mental Stress.

**Scaling by Enemy Type:**
- **Minions:** 3 Physical, 3 Mental Stress (standard)
- **Standard Enemies:** 3-6 Physical, 3-6 Mental Stress
- **Bosses/Major Enemies:** 6-9 Physical, 6-9 Mental Stress

**Examples:**
- TL 2 Minion: 3 Physical, 3 Mental Stress
- TL 3 Standard: 5 Physical, 5 Mental Stress
- TL 4 Boss: 7 Physical, 7 Mental Stress

> **Note:** Future content will include abilities that increase Stress capacity. For now, use these guidelines to create enemies that feel appropriately resilient.

### 3. Condition Slots (Required)

How many Conditions they can take before being taken out.

**Recommended Slots:**
- **Minions:** 1 slot (any severity takes them out)
- **Standard Enemies:** 2-3 slots (typically 1 Minor, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe)
- **Bosses:** 3-4 slots (1-2 Minor, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe)
- **Campaign Villains:** 4-6 slots (2 Minor, 2 Moderate, 1-2 Severe)

### 4. Armor (Optional)

Reduces Stress damage before it's marked.

- **Light Armor:** -1 Stress damage
- **Medium Armor:** -2 Stress damage
- **Heavy Armor:** -3 Stress damage

### 5. Special Modifiers (Optional)

Adjust Threat Level for specific situations.

**Format:** Descriptor (+/- modifier)

**Examples:**
- "Heavily Armored (+1 vs Physical attacks)"
- "Slow and Clumsy (-1 vs Agility-based actions)"
- "Master Duelist (+2 vs melee combat)"
- "Weak-Willed (-1 vs mental/social attacks)"
- "Pack Tactics (+1 when allies present)"

## Enemy Templates

### Minion Template

Use for disposable enemies meant to be overcome quickly.

```
BANDIT THUG
Threat Level: 2
Stress: 3 Physical, 3 Mental
Conditions: 1 slot (any Condition = taken out)
Special: None

When they attack: Players roll to defend (TL 2)
Damage if hit: 3 Physical Stress
```

### Standard Enemy Template

Use for meaningful threats that should take several rounds to overcome.

```
VETERAN GUARD
Threat Level: 3
Stress: 5 Physical, 5 Mental
Conditions: 3 slots (1 Minor, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe)
Armor: Medium (-2 Stress from Physical attacks)
Special: "Disciplined (+1 vs fear/intimidation)"

When they attack: Players roll to defend (TL 3)
Damage if hit: 4 Physical Stress
```

### Boss Template

Use for memorable encounters that define story arcs.

```
MASTER ASSASSIN
Threat Level: 5
Stress: 8 Physical, 8 Mental
Conditions: 4 slots (2 Minor, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe)
Armor: Light (-1 Stress from Physical attacks)
Special:
- "Shadow Step (+2 vs being tracked/noticed)"
- "Poison Expert (attacks may inflict Mental Stress)"
- "Weak to Fire (-1 vs fire-based attacks)"

When they attack: Players roll to defend (TL 5)
Damage if hit: 6 Stress (player chooses Physical or Mental)
```

---

## Running Combat: The GM's Workflow

### 1. Establish the Scene

Describe the environment and any Scene Injections that might help or hinder.

**Example:** "The warehouse is dimly lit (potential -1d6 for ranged attacks), with crates for cover (+1d6 for defense if used), and a chandelier that could be dropped (creative use!)."

### 2. Players Declare Actions

Players say what they're attempting. Ask for their intent (what they want to happen) and their approach (how they're doing it).

### 3. Set the Difficulty

Use the enemy's Threat Level, modified by:
- Special modifiers on the enemy
- Scene Injections (cover, lighting, terrain)
- Player's Burdens (if applicable)
- Circumstances (ambush, surprise, etc.)

### 4. Players Roll

Players assemble their dice pool:
- **Rating** (relevant stat)
- **Focus** (spending Reserve if desired)
- **Anchors** (if applicable)
- **Assets** (if applicable)
- **Aspects** (Scene/Story Injections)
- **Minus Burdens** (if triggered)

### 5. Resolve the Action

**On Success:** The player's intent happens.
- For attacks: Deal Stress damage based on weapon/ability
- For defense: Avoid the enemy's attack
- For other actions: The intended outcome occurs

**On Failure:** The intent doesn't happen, and you make a GM move.
- Enemy deals damage (players mark Stress/take Conditions)
- Situation worsens (reinforcements arrive, alarm sounds)
- Enemy gains advantage (better position, grabs weapon)

### 6. Describe the Outcome

Narrate what happens, honoring the fiction and keeping it dynamic.

## Dealing Damage: How Much Stress?

When an enemy hits a player, how much Stress should they deal?

**Baseline Formula:**
- **Damage = Threat Level + 1 to Threat Level + 2**

**Examples:**
- TL 1 enemy: 2-3 Stress
- TL 2 enemy: 3-4 Stress
- TL 3 enemy: 4-5 Stress
- TL 4 enemy: 5-6 Stress
- TL 5 enemy: 6-7 Stress

**Modifiers:**
- **Weak attack:** -1 Stress
- **Standard attack:** Use formula
- **Powerful attack:** +1-2 Stress
- **Devastating attack:** +2-3 Stress (bosses only, rare)

**Remember:** Players have (Stat Rating + 3) Stress capacity at standard power level. A TL 3 enemy dealing 4-5 Stress will put pressure on a character with 4-6 Stress boxes.

---

## Multiple Enemies

### Swarms of Minions

When players face many weak enemies, don't track each individually.

**Swarm Rule:**
- Group minions in units of 3-5
- Each unit shares a single Stress track and Condition slot
- When the unit takes a Condition, reduce its size (1-2 enemies fall)
- When it reaches 0 enemies, the unit is defeated

**Example:** 12 TL 1 thugs = 3 units of 4 thugs each. Each unit has 3 Physical Stress, 3 Mental Stress, and 1 Condition slot.

### Multiple Standard Enemies

When facing several standard enemies:

**Option A: Simultaneous Attacks**
- Players defend against all attacks with one roll
- Use the **highest Threat Level** among attackers
- On failure, take damage from **all** attackers who would hit

**Option B: Sequential Attacks**
- Players defend against each enemy separately
- More dramatic, but takes longer
- Use when enemies are distinct threats

**Choose based on pacing and dramatic needs.**

---

## Advanced Enemy Design

### Stress Split

Some enemies have unusual Stress distributions:

- **Glass Cannon:** High Mental Stress, low Physical Stress (wizards, psychics)
- **Brute:** High Physical Stress, low Mental Stress (golems, beasts)
- **Balanced:** Equal Physical and Mental (most humanoids)

**Example:**
```
CRYSTAL GOLEM
Threat Level: 4
Stress: 9 Physical, 3 Mental
Conditions: 3 slots
Special: "Mindless (automatically fails Mental Stress tests, but immune to fear/intimidation)"
```

### Escalating Threats

Some enemies get more dangerous as the fight continues:

- **Berserker:** +1 Threat Level after taking first Condition
- **Desperate:** Damage increases by +1 Stress after taking Moderate Condition
- **Adaptive:** Gains +1 to Threat Level against the same tactic twice

### Environmental Enemies

Some "enemies" aren't creatures:

```
RAGING WILDFIRE
Threat Level: 4
Stress: N/A (environmental hazard)
How to Defeat: Not by damage, but by creative problem-solving
When it "attacks": Players in the area must defend (TL 4) or take 5 Physical Stress
Special: Spreads each round, consumes oxygen, creates smoke
```

---

## Condition Severity for Enemies

When enemies overflow Stress and take Conditions, use the same rules as players:

- **1-2 overflow:** Minor Condition (-1d6 to relevant actions)
- **3-4 overflow:** Moderate Condition (-2d6 to relevant actions)
- **5+ overflow:** Severe Condition (-3d6 to relevant actions)

**Name the Condition narratively:**
- "Bleeding Gut Wound" (Severe, -3d6 to Physical actions)
- "Rattled" (Minor, -1d6 to Mental actions)
- "Broken Leg" (Moderate, -2d6 to Agility actions)

**For Minions:** Don't track dice penalties. Any Condition = taken out of the fight.

**For Bosses:** Track Conditions and apply penalties to their Threat Level for relevant actions.

**Example:** A TL 4 boss takes a Moderate "Disarmed" Condition. Their Threat Level for melee attacks becomes TL 2 (4 - 2d6 = effectively TL 2).

---

## Balancing Encounters

### Solo Enemy vs. Party

A solo enemy should be:
- **Threat Level = Party Power Level + 2** (boss fight)
- **Stress = 6-9 boxes per track** (can take sustained assault)
- **Conditions = 4-6 slots** (won't go down in one round)
- **Special abilities** (to create interesting tactical choices)

### Group of Enemies vs. Party

For a balanced fight:
- **Total enemy Stress ≈ Total party Stress × 1.5**
- Mix minions and standard enemies
- Use Threat Levels at or slightly below party Power Level

**Example Party:** 4 players at Power Level 3 (each with 3 Physical Stress = 12 total)

**Balanced Opposition:**
- 6 TL 2 minions (3 Stress each = 18 total)
- OR: 2 TL 3 veterans (5 Stress each = 10 total) + 3 TL 2 minions (3 each = 9 total = 19 total)

### Encounter Difficulty Tiers

**Easy Encounter:** Should drain ~25% of party resources (Stress, Focus)
- Lower Threat Levels, fewer enemies
- Good for: Travel encounters, establishing tone, pacing between hard fights

**Moderate Encounter:** Should drain ~50% of party resources
- Equal Threat Levels, balanced numbers
- Good for: Standard fights, plot advancement, meaningful but not deadly

**Hard Encounter:** Should drain 75%+ of party resources
- Higher Threat Levels, tactical challenges
- Good for: Climactic moments, guarded objectives, consequences matter

**Deadly Encounter:** Could result in Severe Conditions or worse
- Much higher Threat Levels, overwhelming numbers, or both
- Good for: Boss fights, desperate last stands, major story beats

## GM Moves: What to Do on Player Failure

When a player fails their roll, you make a move. Choose something that:
1. Makes sense in the fiction
2. Escalates the situation
3. Creates interesting choices

**Soft Moves** (telegraph danger):
- "The guard notices movement in the shadows..."
- "The orc chief raises his axe, eyes locked on you..."
- "The building starts to creak ominously..."

**Hard Moves** (immediate consequences):
- Deal Stress damage
- Inflict a Condition
- Separate the party
- Introduce a new threat
- Destroy something valuable
- Reveal unwelcome truth
- Put someone in immediate danger

**Choose based on:**
- How badly they failed (margin of failure)
- How dangerous the situation is
- What makes the best story

## Remember

- **Players roll everything** - You describe, they resolve
- **Fiction first** - The narrative drives mechanics, not the other way around
- **Threat Level is flexible** - Adjust for circumstances and story needs
- **Conditions tell stories** - "Broken Ribs" is more interesting than "6 damage"
- **Pacing matters** - Not every fight should be hard; use easy fights to establish competence
- **Enemies are characters** - Give them motivations, fears, and personalities

Your enemies exist to create interesting choices and dramatic moments. Use these tools to craft opposition that challenges players while honoring the fiction.

# Condition Tracks

Instead of hit points, characters track harm through **Condition Tracks**. Damage is separate from your stat Reserves—getting hurt doesn't drain your abilities, but it does make everything harder.

---

## The Two Tracks

Characters have two core Condition Tracks:

| Track        | What It Represents                      | Affects                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Physical** | Bodily harm, injury, exhaustion         | Mighty and Agility rolls (typically)       |
| **Mental**   | Psychological stress, trauma, confusion | Intellect and Persona rolls (typically)    |

**Optional Third Track:** Some campaigns may add a **Social** track for reputation damage, trust loss, and social standing. This is recommended for political intrigue or courtly campaigns.

Each track has **three slots**: Minor, Moderate, and Severe.

---

## Condition Slots

```
PHYSICAL CONDITION TRACK
□ Minor (-1d6)     _______________
□ Moderate (-2d6)  _______________
□ Severe (-3d6)    _______________

MENTAL CONDITION TRACK
□ Minor (-1d6)     _______________
□ Moderate (-2d6)  _______________
□ Severe (-3d6)    _______________
```

**Standard (Gritty):** 1 Minor, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe per track (3 slots total)

**Heroic Variant:** 2 Minor, 2 Moderate, 1 Severe per track (5 slots total) — for pulpier, more resilient heroes

## How Condition Tracks Work

### Taking a Condition

When you take harm (physical, mental, or social), you mark a slot on the appropriate track.

1. **Determine Type:** Is this Physical harm or Mental trauma?
2. **Determine Severity:** Minor (-1d6), Moderate (-2d6), or Severe (-3d6)?
3. **Mark a Slot:** Check the box and name the Condition
4. **Apply Penalty:** The Condition is now a temporary Burden

**Example:** You're slashed by a sword. The GM says: "That's a Moderate Physical Condition."

You mark your Moderate Physical slot and write: **"Deep gash in shoulder (-2d6)"**

From now on, when that Condition applies, you take -2d6 to your rolls.

---

## Naming Your Conditions

When you mark a Condition, **you name it**. The mechanical tier stays the same, but the narrative flavor is yours.

**Physical Examples:**
- Minor: "Bruised ribs," "Sprained ankle," "Exhausted"
- Moderate: "Broken arm," "Concussed," "Deep wound"
- Severe: "Bleeding out," "Shattered leg," "Critical burns"

**Mental Examples:**
- Minor: "Rattled," "Distracted," "Frustrated"
- Moderate: "Terrified," "Paranoid," "Can't focus"
- Severe: "Broken will," "Traumatized," "Losing grip on reality"

**Why Name Conditions?**
- **Memorable:** "Broken ribs" sticks better than "Moderate Physical #2"
- **Guides recovery:** A named Condition suggests how it heals
- **Narrative weight:** "Bleeding out" feels urgent. "Wounded #3" doesn't.

---

## When Conditions Apply

### Physical Conditions

**Typically affect:** Mighty and Agility rolls

**Can affect all rolls when severe enough:**
- "Bleeding out" affects everything—you're dying
- "Exhausted" makes all actions harder
- "Broken leg" primarily affects movement, but might penalize other physical actions

**GM discretion:** Physical Conditions apply when they would realistically hinder the action.

### Mental Conditions

**Typically affect:** Intellect and Persona rolls

**Examples:**
- "Rattled" (-1d6) makes it hard to concentrate or stay calm
- "Terrified" (-2d6) affects decision-making and social confidence
- "Traumatized" (-3d6) impacts all mental and social actions

**Can affect physical rolls in some cases:**
- "Panicked" might make your hands shake during a delicate task
- "Distracted" could affect aim or coordination

---

## Player Choice: Shifting Conditions

Players have some agency in **how** they take Conditions. When you take a hit, you can sometimes shift the Condition to a different track with narrative justification.

**Example: Sword Strike**

**GM:** "The bandit's sword connects. That's a Moderate consequence."

**Player Options:**

1. **Take it straight:** Mark Moderate Physical — "Deep gash in shoulder" (-2d6)

2. **Split it across slots (if available):**
   - Mark Minor Physical + Minor Mental
   - "Shallow cut" (-1d6) + "Shaken confidence" (-1d6)
   - Same total penalty (-2d6), but preserves the Moderate slot for later

3. **Shift to Mental (with justification):**
   - Mark Moderate Mental instead
   - "The near-miss rattled me—I'm losing my nerve" (-2d6)
   - The sword didn't physically hit, but the fear did

**Rule:** Must make narrative sense. GM can veto if absurd.

**Why allow this?**
- Players get tactical choice
- Encourages creative consequence interpretation
- Some characters might prefer mental strain over physical (or vice versa)

---

## Being Taken Out

### When One Track Fills

When all slots in a track are full, you're **vulnerable** in that area. You can still act, but:
- Physical Track Full: Next Physical consequence takes you out (unconscious, dying, captured)
- Mental Track Full: Next Mental consequence takes you out (catatonic, fleeing, broken)

### Taking Consequences with Full Tracks

**Option 1: Use another track (with justification)**
- Physical track full, but Mental has space? Take it as Mental trauma instead
- Example: "I can't take another physical hit—the pain is breaking me mentally"

**Option 2: Overflow = Taken Out**
- If all tracks that make sense are full, you're out of the scene
- Knocked unconscious, fleeing in panic, captured, dying—whatever makes narrative sense

---

## Stacking Conditions

Multiple Conditions can apply to the same roll. They stack.

**Example:** You have:
- Physical: "Broken ribs" (-2d6)
- Mental: "Rattled" (-1d6)

You're trying to climb a wall (Agility + concentration). Both apply.
**Total penalty:** -3d6

**Example 2:** You have:
- Physical: "Exhausted" (-1d6)
- Physical: "Bleeding" (-2d6)

You're fighting. Both apply to physical actions.
**Total penalty:** -3d6 to all physical rolls

---

## Recovery

Conditions don't heal automatically. You need:

### Physical Recovery
- **Short Rest (10 minutes):** Catch your breath, bandage wounds
  - May clear Minor Physical Conditions at GM discretion
- **Medical Care:** Successful Intellect roll (Difficulty 2-4)
  - Can clear or downgrade Conditions based on success
- **Full Rest (8 hours):** Clears one Physical Condition
- **Extended Downtime (days/weeks):** Clears all but Severe Conditions

### Mental Recovery
- **Short Break:** Brief respite, calming down
  - May clear Minor Mental Conditions
- **Therapy/Support:** Social scenes, talking it through
  - Can downgrade Mental Conditions
- **Full Rest (8 hours):** Clears one Mental Condition
- **Time and Resolution:** Some Mental Conditions require narrative resolution

**GM Tip:** Don't let Conditions linger forever. Recovery should be achievable.

---

## Death and Dying

### The Death Spiral

When all Physical slots are marked, you're in danger. The next Physical consequence takes you out.

**Taken Out doesn't always mean dead:**
- Unconscious
- Captured
- Fleeing in terror
- Dying (but can be saved)

**Actual Death:**
- Usually requires player consent OR clear narrative setup
- GMs should telegraph lethal threats: "This next hit could kill you."
- Death should be rare, meaningful, and dramatic—not random

**Alternatives to Death:**
- Accept a permanent Burden to survive (lose an eye, traumatic memory, etc.)
- Use Narrative Injection to reframe the outcome
- Surrender or retreat before death occurs

---

## Power Level Variants

Different campaigns want different lethality and resilience. Adjust Condition slots accordingly:

| Power Level | Physical Slots          | Mental Slots            | Tone             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Gritty**  | 1 Minor, 1 Mod, 1 Sev   | 1 Minor, 1 Mod, 1 Sev   | Deadly, tense    |
| **Heroic**  | 2 Minor, 1 Mod, 1 Sev   | 2 Minor, 1 Mod, 1 Sev   | Balanced         |
| **Epic**    | 2 Minor, 2 Mod, 1 Sev   | 2 Minor, 2 Mod, 1 Sev   | Pulp action      |

Gritty characters can take 3-6 hits before going down.
Epic characters can take 5-10 hits.

---

## Optional: Social Conditions

For campaigns focused on intrigue, politics, or reputation:

```
SOCIAL CONDITION TRACK
□ Minor (-1d6)     _______________
□ Moderate (-2d6)  _______________
□ Severe (-3d6)    _______________
```

**Examples:**
- Minor: "Embarrassed," "Caught in a lie," "Awkward moment"
- Moderate: "Publicly shamed," "Lost an important ally," "Reputation damaged"
- Severe: "Exiled," "Completely discredited," "Betrayed by everyone"

**When to use Social track:**
- Failed social rolls with consequences
- Public failures or betrayals
- Reputation attacks
- Political maneuvering gone wrong

**Social Conditions affect:** Persona rolls and social situations primarily

**Recovery:** Requires public redemption, reputation repair, or time

---

## Armor and Damage Reduction

Armor doesn't add dice. Instead, it **reduces Condition severity**.

| Armor Type | Effect                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Light      | Reduce Condition by 1 level  |
| Medium     | Reduce Condition by 2 levels |
| Heavy      | Reduce Condition by 3 levels |

**Example:** You take a hit that would inflict Moderate Physical. You're wearing Medium armor. It reduces by 2 levels: Moderate → Minor → Negated.

**Armor can't reduce below Minor.** Even in full plate, a solid hit still hurts.

**Armor typically only applies to Physical Conditions.** Mental and Social Conditions bypass armor.

---

## Quick Reference

**Condition Tracks:** Physical (Mighty/Agility), Mental (Intellect/Persona), Social (Persona/social) [optional]

**Slots (Standard):** 1 Minor (-1d6), 1 Moderate (-2d6), 1 Severe (-3d6) per track

**Slots (Heroic):** 2 Minor, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe per track

**Players choose:** Where to take Conditions (with narrative justification)

**Stacking:** Multiple Conditions = multiple penalties

**Taken Out:** When track is full, next appropriate Condition takes you out of the scene

**Recovery:** Rest, medical care, therapy, time, or narrative resolution

**Armor:** Reduces Physical Condition severity (Light -1, Medium -2, Heavy -3)

---

## Example in Play

**Round 1: Combat Begins**

**GM:** "The thug swings a pipe at your head. Make an Agility roll to dodge."

**Player:** *Rolls, fails*

**GM:** "It connects. That's a Minor Physical Condition."

**Player:** *Marks Minor Physical, writes "Bruised jaw (-1d6)"*

---

**Round 2: Things Get Worse**

**GM:** "He follows up with a gut punch. You're hit. That's a Moderate Physical Condition."

**Player:** *Looks at sheet* "Can I take this as mental instead? The pain is overwhelming—I'm losing focus."

**GM:** "That's a stretch for a gut punch. It's physical damage. Mark it."

**Player:** *Marks Moderate Physical, writes "Cracked ribs (-2d6)"*

**Now has:** -1d6 (bruised jaw) + -2d6 (cracked ribs) = -3d6 to physical actions

---

**Round 3: Desperate Situation**

**GM:** "He's going for another hit. This one's Severe if it lands."

**Player:** "I only have Severe Physical left. If I take that, I'm one hit from being taken out."

**GM:** "Correct. You better dodge or fight back."

**Player:** *Spends Effort, uses Anchor, rolls... succeeds!* "I counter-punch and knock him down!"

**GM:** "Nice. He's stunned. You have a moment."

---

**After Combat: Recovery**

**GM:** "You have ten minutes before reinforcements arrive. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I catch my breath and bandage my jaw. Can I clear the Minor Physical?"

**GM:** "Yeah, a short rest is enough for that. You clear 'Bruised jaw.' But the cracked ribs are staying until you get real medical care."

**Player:** *Erases Minor Physical Condition. Still has Moderate Physical (-2d6) for the rest of the session.*

---

## Final Thought

Condition Tracks make harm meaningful without spiraling into unplayability. You're wounded, but not helpless. You're battered, but still dangerous.

**Getting hurt should scare you—but not stop you.**

Use your slots wisely. Fight smart. Retreat when necessary. And remember: sometimes the best move is to avoid the fight entirely.

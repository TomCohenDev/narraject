# What Is NullFrame?

NullFrame is a tabletop RPG about **creating epic cinematic stories through fast, tactical play**.

It walks the narrow line between crunchy mechanics and narrative freedom. You build dice pools, spend resources, and make choices—but every roll is about **what you want to happen**, not just whether you hit or miss.

**Declare your intent. Roll the dice. If you succeed, it happens—exactly as you described.**

Want to kill the dragon with a fork? That's 10 marks. Can you build a pool big enough? That's the question. The system gives you the tools—ratings, reserves, traits, gear, and special abilities called **Narrative Injections**. How you combine them determines what's possible.

## The Elevator Pitch

You're a master sniper taking an impossible shot. In most games, you roll, you hit or miss, you move on.

In NullFrame, you roll your dice pool and count your **Successes** (d6s showing 5-6). If your number of success is equal or above the difficulty rating the you succeeded in your intent!

But you also have **Injections**—special abilities defined on your character sheet. Those injections can complete chance the scene even in retrospect!

## What You Need to Play

- **Dice:** Lots of d6s (10+ recommended), plus d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, and d12s
- **Cards:** They represent various aspects in the scene or you character 
- **Character sheets:** You can use the pdf or the online character sheets

## Core Concepts

### The Dice Pool

When you attempt something risky, you roll a pool of six-sided dice (d6s). The more dice, the better your odds. You build this pool from your **Rating** (innate capability), **Reserve** (spendable effort), traits, gear, and circumstances.

### The Injector Die

Injections are special abilities defined on your character sheet. Each Injection has an **Injector Die** (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12) permanently assigned to it.

### Successes and Success

Count the dice showing **5 or higher**. Each one is a **Success**. Compare your Successes to the difficulty (0-10+). Meet or exceed the difficulty, and you succeed.

> **The Golden Rule:** If you succeed on the roll, your intent happens. Period. No "you hit but didn't do enough damage." Success means what you described becomes true.

### Injector Points (IPs)

**Injector Points** are currency for narrative control. You earn them by accepting complications. You spend them to inject facts, assets, and twists into the story.

The GM has IPs too. The economy flows both ways.

### Narrative Injection

This is the game's core hook. At any moment, you can spend IPs to **inject** something into the scene:

- "There's a fire escape on this building."
- "This guard served in my old unit."
- "I brought a grappling hook, actually."

You're not asking the GM if these things are true. You're _making_ them true—within reason, and within your budget.

## What Kind of Stories?

NullFrame is **setting-agnostic**. The core mechanics work for:

- **Cyberpunk:** Hackers, mercenaries, corporate espionage
- **Fantasy:** Swords, sorcery, dungeon delving
- **Sci-Fi:** Starships, alien contact, space horror
- **Modern:** Spies, heists, supernatural investigation
- **Post-Apocalypse:** Survival, scavenging, community building

The GM section includes guidance for adapting the game to different genres.

## Design Philosophy

> **Crunch serves narrative.** Tactical choices should create cinematic moments, not slow them down.
> **Intent matters.** Every roll answers "what happens?" not just "do I succeed?"
> **Resources create tension.** Spending reserves, activating abilities, accepting complications—these choices make scenes feel urgent.
> **Fast resolution.** Rolls take seconds.
> **The GM sets difficulty to match ambition.** Want something impossible? Fine. Here's how hard it is. Now decide if you're going for it.
> **Success means success.** If you meet the difficulty, your intent happens. Period. No "yes, but" unless you choose to accept one.

# What Is Narraject?

Narraject is a tabletop roleplaying game about **identity under pressure**.

You roll dice to see if you succeed. But more importantly, you roll **your die**—the one that represents who you are—to see if you succeed _as yourself_.

## The Elevator Pitch

You're a master sniper taking an impossible shot. In most games, you roll, you hit or miss, you move on.

In Narraject, you roll your dice pool and count your **Marks** (d6s showing 5-6, or Injector Dice showing 5-9 for 1 Mark, 10+ for 2 Marks).

But you also have **Injections**—special abilities defined on your character sheet. When you spend **1 IP** to activate an Injection, you add its **Injector Die** (d4-d12) to your roll.

**If the Injector Die rolls 3+**, your Injection succeeds. The narrative effect happens.

**If it rolls 1-2**, your Injection fails—even if your main action succeeds. That's the risk of using your signature abilities.

The die size represents **reliability and narrative weight**, not raw power. A d12 Injection is safer to use. A d4 Injection is volatile but potentially powerful.

**That's Narraject.** A game where your character's special abilities are mechanically central, not just flavor text.

Injections aren't bonuses. They're your signature moves.

## Core Concepts

### The Dice Pool

When you attempt something risky, you roll a pool of six-sided dice (d6s). The more dice, the better your odds. You build this pool from your **Rating** (innate capability), **Reserve** (spendable effort), traits, gear, and circumstances.

### The Injector Die

Injections are special abilities defined on your character sheet. Each Injection has an **Injector Die** (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12) permanently assigned to it.

When you spend **1 IP** to activate an Injection, you add its Injector Die to your roll. The die size represents reliability and narrative weight—not raw power. A d12 Injection is safer to use. A d4 Injection is risky but potentially powerful.

The Injector Die does two things: it contributes Marks to your action (5-9 = 1 Mark, 10+ = 2 Marks), and it determines whether your Injection succeeds (3+ succeeds, 1-2 fails).

### Marks and Success

Count the dice showing **5 or higher**. Each one is a **Mark**. Compare your Marks to the difficulty (0-10+). Meet or exceed the difficulty, and you succeed.

> **The Golden Rule:** If you succeed on the roll, your intent happens. Period. No "you hit but didn't do enough damage." Success means what you described becomes true.

### Injector Points (IPs)

**Injector Points** are currency for narrative control. You earn them by accepting complications. You spend them to inject facts, assets, and twists into the story.

The GM has IPs too. The economy flows both ways.

### Narrative Injection

This is the game's core hook. At any moment, you can spend IPs to **inject** something into the scene:

- "There's a fire escape on this building."
- "This guard served in my old unit."
- "I brought a grappling hook, actually."

You're not asking the GM if these things are true. You're _making_ them true—within reason, and within your budget.

## The Flow of Play

1. **The GM sets the scene.** What's happening? What's at stake?
2. **Players declare actions.** What are you trying to do?
3. **Roll dice when it matters.** Build your pool, roll, count Marks.
4. **Resolve Injections (if used).** Did your Injection succeed or fail?
5. **The GM narrates the outcome.** Success, failure, or something in between.
6. **IPs change hands.** Complications accepted, injections spent.
7. **Repeat.**

## What Kind of Stories?

Narraject is **setting-agnostic**. The core mechanics work for:

- **Cyberpunk:** Hackers, mercenaries, corporate espionage
- **Fantasy:** Swords, sorcery, dungeon delving
- **Sci-Fi:** Starships, alien contact, space horror
- **Modern:** Spies, heists, supernatural investigation
- **Post-Apocalypse:** Survival, scavenging, community building

The GM section includes guidance for adapting the game to different genres.

## Design Philosophy

> **Narraject believes:**
>
> Your character's identity should matter mechanically, not just narratively.
>
> Complications should be _offered_, not imposed. You choose your drama.
>
> More dice feels better than bigger modifiers.
>
> The GM's job is hard enough. The system should make it easier.
>
> Every roll should tell a story, even if it's just "I got lucky."

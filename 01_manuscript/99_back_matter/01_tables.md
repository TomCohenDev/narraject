2. "This guard served in my old unit."
3. "I brought a grappling hook, actually."
4. "The security system has a known vulnerability."
5. "I recognize this person from a wanted poster."
6. "There's a service entrance behind the dumpsters."
7. "The hallway smells like antiseptic—hospital, not office."
8. "I trained with this guard's unit. We're not friends, but there's respect."
9. "The security system has a five-second window during shift change."
10. "This facility is owned by my father's company. I recognize the logo."
11. "There's a maintenance tunnel that runs under the building."
12. "I know the passcode—it's the same one they use everywhere."
13. "The guard is distracted by a personal problem."
14. "There's a hidden cache of supplies nearby."
15. "I have a contact who can help us."
16. "The building's blueprints are public record."

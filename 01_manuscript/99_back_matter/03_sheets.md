## Quick Reference

**Pool Formula:** Rating + Effort + Traits + Gear + Aspects - Flaws

**Mark:** d6s showing 5-6 = 1 Mark each.

**Success:** Marks ≥ Difficulty

**Injections:**

- Spend 1 IP → Roll Injector Die separately (not part of pool)
- Roll 3+ → Injection succeeds, creates Aspect
- Roll 1-2 → Injection fails
- Roll 5-9 → Minor Aspect (+1d6 to related future rolls)
- Roll 10+ → Significant Aspect (+2d6 to related future rolls)

**The Golden Rule:** Success = Intent Happens. Period.

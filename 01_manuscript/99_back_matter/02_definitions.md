A glossary of key terms.

## Core Terms

**Mark:** Any die showing 5 or higher. You count Marks to determine success.

**Step Die:** Your signature die (d6/d8/d10/d12) that represents your identity. Reading the Step Die tells you _how_ you succeeded or failed.

**Rating:** Your innate capability for a stat. You always roll at least Rating dice.

**Reserve:** Spendable effort for a stat. You spend from Reserve to add more dice. Capacity = (Rating × 2) + 5.

**Exertion:** Spending points from your Reserve to add dice to a roll.

**Injector Points (IPs):** Currency for narrative control. You earn them by accepting complications. You spend them to inject facts, assets, and twists into the story.

**Narrative Injection:** A player-initiated fact, asset, or twist inserted into the fiction by spending IPs.

**GM Intrusion:** A complication the GM introduces. Not a punishment—an _offer_. The GM offers 2 IPs to accept it.

## Character Terms

**Package:** Your archetype (The Muscle, The Face, The Tech, The Scout). Determines starting stats and core ability.

**Focus:** Your signature specialty (verb phrase). Determines your Step Die and unique powers.

**Descriptor:** Who you are as a person (adjective). Adds flavor, minor bonuses, and a flaw.

**Trait:** A skill, background, or knack. Basic Traits add +1d6, Advanced Traits add +2d6.

**Condition:** A penalty from damage or stress. Hurt (-1d6), Wounded (-2d6), Critical (-3d6). Conditions stack.

## Action Terms

**Intent:** What you want to achieve and _how_ you're doing it. Success means your Intent happens. Period.

**Difficulty:** How many Marks you need to succeed. Set by the GM based on the ambition of your Intent.

**Pool:** Your total dice for a roll. Pool = Rating + Exertion + Traits + Gear + Situational + Step Die.

**Success:** Marks ≥ Difficulty. Success means your Intent happens. Period.

**Failure:** Marks < Difficulty. You don't get what you wanted.

## Combat Terms

**Zone:** Theater of the Mind range. Engaged (melee), Near (close), Far (distant).

**Popcorn Initiative:** Whoever acts picks who goes next. Keeps combat dynamic.

**Armor:** Reduces Condition severity. Light (-1 level), Medium (-2 levels), Heavy (-3 levels).

**Weapon:** Adds dice to attack pools. Standard (+1d6), Quality (+2d6), Masterwork (+3d6).

## Economy Terms

**Accept Intrusion:** Take the GM's complication, receive 2 IPs, give 1 to another player.

**Refuse Intrusion:** Spend 1 IP to reject the GM's complication. The complication doesn't happen.

**Free Intrusion:** A complication that happens automatically (Step Die 1-2, Zero Marks). No IPs offered.

**Injection:** Spending IPs to add facts, assets, or twists to the story.

## The Golden Rule

**Success = Intent Happens. Period.**

If you succeed on the roll, your Intent happens. No "you hit but didn't do enough damage." No "you persuaded him but he still won't do it." Success means what you described becomes true.

This is the most important rule in Narraject. Use it. Trust it. It makes the game better.

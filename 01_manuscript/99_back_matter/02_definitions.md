A glossary of key terms.

## Core Terms

**Success:** Any d6 showing 5 or 6 counts as 1 Success. You count Successes to determine success.

**Injector Die:** A special die (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12) assigned to an Injection. Rolled separately (never as part of your dice pool) when you spend IP to activate that Injection.

**Rating:** Your innate capability for a stat. You always roll at least Rating dice.

**Reserve:** Spendable effort for a stat. You spend from Reserve to add more dice. Capacity = (Rating × 2) + 5.

**Exertion:** Spending points from your Reserve to add dice to a roll.

**Injector Points (IPs):** Currency for narrative control. You earn them by accepting complications or good roleplay. You spend them to activate Injections or for advancement.

**Injection:** A special, powerful ability defined on your character sheet. Each Injection has an assigned Injector Die (d4-d12). Cost 1 IP to activate. Always rolled standalone to create Aspects.

**Injector Die:** A special die (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12) assigned to an Injection. Rolled standalone (not as part of action rolls) to create Aspects.

**GM Injection:** A complication the GM introduces. Not a punishment—an _offer_. The GM offers 1 IP to accept it, or you can spend 1 IP to refuse it.

## Character Terms

**Package:** Your archetype (The Muscle, The Face, The Tech, The Scout). Determines starting stats and core ability.

**Focus:** Your signature specialty (verb phrase). Determines your unique powers and abilities.

**Descriptor:** Who you are as a person (adjective). Adds flavor, a trait, and a flaw.

**Trait:** A skill, background, or knack. Can be Broad ("Athletics") or Specific ("Underwater Basket Weaving"). Basic Traits add +1d6, Advanced Traits add +2d6, Master Traits add +3d6.

**Flaw:** A narrative weakness that removes dice when it applies. You must have 1 Flaw for every 1 Trait (Rule of Balance).

**Aspect:** A beneficial condition, relationship, or fact that adds dice to related rolls. Aspects can be created by standalone Injections or granted by the GM. Minor Aspects add +1d6, significant Aspects add +2d6.

**Condition:** A penalty from damage or stress. Hurt (-1d6), Wounded (-2d6), Critical (-3d6). Conditions stack.

## Action Terms

**Intent:** What you want to achieve and _how_ you're doing it. Success means your Intent happens. Period.

**Difficulty:** How many Successes you need to succeed. Set by the GM based on the ambition of your Intent.

**Pool:** Your total dice for a roll. Pool = Rating + Effort + Traits + Gear + Aspects - Flaws.

**Success:** Successes ≥ Difficulty. Success means your Intent happens. Period.

**Failure:** Successes < Difficulty. You don't get what you wanted.

## Combat Terms

**Zone:** Theater of the Mind range. Engaged (melee), Near (close), Far (distant).

**Popcorn Initiative:** Whoever acts picks who goes next. Keeps combat dynamic.

**Armor:** Reduces Condition severity. Light (-1 level), Medium (-2 levels), Heavy (-3 levels).

**Weapon:** Adds dice to attack pools. Standard (+1d6), Quality (+2d6), Masterwork (+3d6).

## Economy Terms

**Accept Injection:** Take the GM's complication, receive 1 IP.

**Refuse Injection:** Spend 1 IP to reject the GM's complication. The complication doesn't happen.

**Free Injection:** A complication that happens automatically (Zero Successes). No IPs offered.

**Activate Injection:** Spend 1 IP to roll an Injector Die standalone, creating an Aspect on success. The Aspect provides bonuses to future rolls.

## The Golden Rule

**Success = Intent Happens. Period.**

If you succeed on the roll, your Intent happens. No "you hit but didn't do enough damage." No "you persuaded him but he still won't do it." Success means what you described becomes true.

This is the most important rule in Run By Null. Use it. Trust it. It makes the game better.

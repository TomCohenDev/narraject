# Building the Dice Pool

When something matters—when there's risk and uncertainty—you roll dice. This chapter explains how.

---

## The Basic Question

Every roll answers: **Do you succeed, and did you succeed as yourself?**

The first part comes from your d6 pool. The second comes from your Step Die.

---

## When to Roll

Roll when:
- The outcome is uncertain
- Failure has consequences
- Success isn't trivial

Don't roll when:
- The task is routine
- There's no time pressure or opposition
- Failure would just mean "roll again"

> **GM Tip:** If failure wouldn't be interesting, don't call for a roll. Just say yes.

---

## Step 1: Declare Your Intent

Tell the GM what you're trying to accomplish and how you're approaching it.

**Not:** "I roll to attack."  
**Instead:** "I'm trying to disarm him by hooking his blade with mine."

The *how* matters because it determines which stat and traits apply.

## Step 2: The GM Sets Difficulty

The GM tells you how many **Hits** you need.

| Hits Needed | Difficulty | Example |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Easy | Climb a ladder, spot an obvious clue |
| 2 | Moderate | Pick a simple lock, persuade a neutral stranger |
| 3 | Challenging | Hit a moving target, hack a secured system |
| 4 | Hard | Scale a sheer wall in rain, convince a hostile NPC |
| 5 | Heroic | Impossible shot, walk on fire, sway a crowd against their beliefs |
| 6+ | Legendary | Feats of myth |

The GM may not always tell you the exact number—sometimes you just know it's "hard."

## Step 3: Build Your Pool

Gather d6s from every applicable source:

### Stat Spend (Required)
Choose the relevant stat (Might, Agility, Mind, or Persona). Spend points from that pool. Each point = **1d6**.

You must spend at least 1 point. Your stat pool is a resource—spend wisely.

### Traits (Optional)
If you have a relevant **Trait**, add dice:
- Basic Trait: **+1d6**
- Advanced Trait: **+2d6**

Traits are skills, backgrounds, and knacks. See Character Creation.

### Gear (Optional)
Relevant equipment adds dice:
- Standard gear: **+1d6**
- Quality gear: **+2d6**

A lockpick helps you pick locks. A rifle helps you shoot. Gear without relevance adds nothing.

### Situational Aspects (GM Granted)
The GM may grant bonus dice for advantageous circumstances:
- High ground: +1d6
- Surprise: +1d6 to +2d6
- Perfect conditions: +1d6

## Step 4: Add Your Step Die

In addition to your d6 pool, add exactly **one Step Die**.

Your Step Die comes from your most relevant **Focus** or signature trait:

| Trait Level | Step Die |
|-------------|----------|
| Untrained / Generic | d6 |
| Trained | d8 |
| Expert | d10 |
| Master | d12 |

If no specific trait applies, you roll a d6 as your Step Die—representing generic competence.

> **Important:** You only ever roll ONE Step Die per roll. If multiple traits could apply, use the highest—but that trait defines your approach.

**Example:** You're infiltrating a compound. You have "Expert Stealth" (d10) and "Trained Lockpicking" (d8). If you're sneaking past guards, use the d10. If you're picking the back door, use the d8. If you're sneaking *to* the door *then* picking it, choose which moment this roll represents.

## Example: Building a Pool

**Situation:** Kira needs to shoot a fleeing target from a rooftop.

**GM:** "That's Challenging—3 Hits. It's windy, but you have a clear sightline."

**Kira's player:** "I'll spend 3 from my Agility pool. I have 'Expert Marksman' so that's +2d6. My scoped rifle is +1d6 for quality gear. And my Focus is 'Never Misses'—that's a d10 Step Die."

**Pool:** 3d6 (stat) + 2d6 (trait) + 1d6 (gear) + 1d10 (Step Die) = **6d6 + 1d10**

Now she rolls and counts Hits. See the next section.

---

## Pool Limits

There's no hard cap, but practical limits apply:
- Stat pools deplete with spending
- Each trait only applies once per roll
- Gear requires you to actually have it

A fully stacked pool might be 8-10 dice. That's fine—you built it, you earned it.

## Summary

| Source | Dice Added |
|--------|------------|
| Stat Spend | 1d6 per point |
| Basic Trait | +1d6 |
| Advanced Trait | +2d6 |
| Standard Gear | +1d6 |
| Quality Gear | +2d6 |
| Situational Bonus | +1d6 to +2d6 (GM) |
| Step Die | d6 / d8 / d10 / d12 |

Grab your dice. It's time to roll.

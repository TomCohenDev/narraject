# Core Mechanics: The Roll

In **Narraject**, some actions or situations call for a roll so the story moves forward with unexpected results. This chapter explains how to build your dice hand, resolve actions, and use your identity to shape the outcome.

> **Before We Start: Anatomy of a Character**
> To make a roll, you need to know what is on your character sheet:
> - **Stats:** You have 4 Stats (Might, Agility, Intellect, Persona). Each has a **Rating** (dice you always roll when using that stat, this is your base for that stat) and a **Reserve** (effort you may spend that add additional dice).
> - **Character Injections:** Your character's defining elements:
>   - **Anchors:** Background elements and skills (e.g., "Hacker," "Soldier") that add dice. Can be **Broad** ("Athletics") or **Specific** ("Underwater Basket Weaving").
>   - **Burdens:** Narrative weaknesses that remove dice when they apply.
>   - **Assets:** Tools and weapons that add dice.
> - **Narrative Injection:** Once per session, you can inject a story fact or context at any moment (see Narrative Injection chapter).
> - **Aspects:** Elements injected into the narrative that can add dice:
>   - **Character Injections:** Anchors, Burdens, Conditions, Assets on your sheet
>   - **Scene Injections:** Environmental factors (e.g., "High ground," "Smoke-filled room")
>   - **Story Injections:** Ongoing narrative elements (e.g., "Looming darkness over town")

## The Core Loop

1.  **Declare Intent:** "I want to [Goal] by [Approach]."
2.  **Set Difficulty:** The GM tells you how many **Successes** you need.
3.  **Build hand:** Gather d6s from your Rating, Reserve (Focus), Anchors, Assets, and Aspects. Subtract dice for Burdens if they apply.
4.  **Roll:** Count Successes (5+).
5.  **Result:** Succeed or Fail. Reality changes.

> **Note:** Narrative Injection is not part of dice rolls—it's used to inject story facts and context at any moment. See **Narrative Injection** chapter.

---

## When to Roll

Roll only when:

- The outcome is uncertain.
- Failure has consequences.
- Success isn't trivial.

**Do not roll** when the task is routine, there is no pressure, or failure just means "nothing happens."

> **GM Tip:** If failure wouldn't be interesting, don't call for a roll. Just say yes.

---

## Step 1: Declare Your Intent

Tell the GM exactly what you want to achieve and _how_ you are doing it. This is the most important step in the entire game because of one golden rule:

### Success = Intent Happens

There is no "you hit him but didn't do enough damage." There is no "you persuaded him but he still won't do it." If the dice say success, the reality you described becomes true.

### Ambition Sets Difficulty

Because success guarantees the outcome, the _ambition_ of your intent sets the Difficulty.

- **"I want to distract the dragon by throwing a rock."**
  - **Difficulty:** Moderate (2 Successes).
  - **Success:** The dragon looks away for a moment.
- **"I want to kill the dragon instantly by throwing a fork into its eye."**
  - **Difficulty:** Legendary (10 Successes).
  - **Success:** The fork pierces the brain. The dragon dies.

You can attempt anything—even killing a dragon with a fork. The GM will never say "you can't try." They will simply set the Difficulty to match the impossibility of the task. If you can build a hand big enough to hit 10 Successes, then yes, you kill the dragon with a fork.

### Balancing Risk and Reward

Your intent matters for the difficulty.

- **Safe Intent:** "I slash at the bandit's torso to drive him back."
  - **Difficulty:** Moderate (2 Successes).
  - **Outcome:** He retreats, but is still alive and fighting.
- **Risky Intent:** "I slash at his neck to take his head off."
  - **Difficulty:** Hard (4 Successes).
  - **Outcome:** He is dead instantly.
- **Creative Intent:** "I persuade the King to give us the army... by performing a perfect ancestral dance."
  - **Difficulty:** Very Hard (5 Successes) because it's an unconventional approach.
  - **Outcome:** The King is moved to tears and grants you the army.

Be specific. Be ambitious. Be creative. But remember: the bigger the request, the harder the roll.

---

## Step 2: The GM Sets Difficulty

The GM determines how many **Successes** you need. A **Success** is any die showing **5 or higher**.

| Successes Needed | Difficulty      | Example                                             |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **0**            | **Trivial**     | Routine task. No roll needed.                       |
| **1**            | **Easy**        | Climb a ladder, spot an obvious clue.               |
| **2**            | **Moderate**    | Pick a simple lock, persuade a neutral stranger.    |
| **3**            | **Challenging** | Hit a moving target, hack a secured system.         |
| **4**            | **Hard**        | Scale a sheer wall in rain, convince a hostile NPC. |
| **5-6**          | **Very Hard**   | Near-impossible shot, walk on fire.                 |
| **7-8**          | **Heroic**      | Feats that define legends.                          |
| **9-10**         | **Legendary**   | Once-in-a-lifetime achievements.                    |
| **10+**          | **Mythic**      | Feats of gods.                                      |

The GM may state the exact number ("That's 4 Successes") or describe it ("That's very hard"). Both work.

## Step 3: Build Your Hand

You don't just roll a stat. You build a hand of dice from who you are and what you're doing.

`DICE HAND = Rating + Focus + Anchors + Assets + Aspects - Burdens`

### 1. Stats (Rating, Reserve & Focus)

Every character has four stats. Each stat has:
- A **Rating** (Dice you always have)
- A **Reserve** (Total effort pool you can spend)
- An **Focus** (Maximum effort you can spend on a single roll)

**Reserve Capacity** = (Rating × 2) + 5 for Rating 1-5, or (Rating × 3) + 2 for Rating 6-10
**Focus Cap** = Rating + 2

| Stat        | Rating | Reserve Capacity | Focus Cap |
| :---------- | :----- | :--------------- | :--------- |
| **Level 1** | 1d6    | 7 points         | 3          |
| **Level 2** | 2d6    | 9 points         | 4          |
| **Level 3** | 3d6    | 11 points        | 5          |

- **Start with Rating:** Grab d6s equal to your Stat Rating. This is your floor.
- **Add Focus (Optional):** You may spend points from your Reserve to add dice. **1 Point = +1d6**.
  - **Focus Cap:** You can only spend up to your Focus value on a single roll.
  - **Example:** If you have Agility 3 (Reserve: 11, Focus: 5), you can spend up to 5 Reserve on one roll, even if you have more available.

### 2. Your Approach Defines the Stat

In Narraject, actions are not locked to specific stats. You use the stat that matches your description.

| Stat          | Domain                                                   |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Might**     | Physical power, endurance, melee combat, resisting harm. |
| **Agility**   | Speed, reflexes, coordination, stealth, balance.         |
| **Intellect** | Knowledge, perception, reasoning, technical skills.      |
| **Persona**   | Social influence, willpower, presence, deception.        |

> **Example: Opening a Locked Door**
> - **Might:** You kick the hinge until it snaps.
> - **Agility:** You slide a lockpick into the tumbler.
> - **Intellect:** You hotwire the electronic keypad panel.
> - **Persona:** You shout "Open up!" and hope they listen.

> **Example: Getting Past a Guard**
> - **Might:** You physically overpower them, pinning them to the wall.
> - **Agility:** You slip past silently while they're distracted.
> - **Intellect:** You memorize their patrol pattern and time your approach perfectly.
> - **Persona:** You convince them you're authorized to be here.

> **Example: Finding Information**
> - **Might:** You break into a filing cabinet and rummage through papers.
> - **Agility:** You pickpocket the key from someone's pocket.
> - **Intellect:** You recall reading about this in a book last week.
> - **Persona:** You charm a librarian into letting you access restricted archives.

> **Example: Stopping an Enemy Attack**
> - **Might:** You grab their weapon arm and wrench it away.
> - **Agility:** You dodge at the last second, making them overbalance.
> - **Intellect:** You predict their move from their stance and intercept.
> - **Persona:** You shout a command that makes them hesitate.

**The Golden Rule:** If you can justify the narrative, you can use the stat.

### 3. Anchors

If your character has relevant training, background, or skills, add more d6s.

Anchors can be **Broad** ("Athletics") or **Specific** ("Underwater Basket Weaving"). The scope affects when they apply, not their mechanical bonus.

| Impact              | Bonus | Notes                         |
| :------------------ | :---- | :---------------------------- |
| **Minor Anchor**    | +1d6  | Relevant background or skill. |
| **Moderate Anchor** | +2d6  | Specialized training.         |
| **Major Anchor**    | +3d6  | Exceptional mastery.          |

### 4. Burdens

If a Burden applies to the situation, it removes dice from your pool. Burdens are narrative weaknesses, fears, or physical limitations that mechanically hinder you.

- **Minor Burden:** -1d6
- **Moderate Burden:** -2d6
- **Major Burden:** -3d6

See the **Anchors** and **Burdens** chapters for details and the Rule of Balance (1 Burden for every 1 Anchor).

### 5. Assets

If you have relevant equipment, add more d6s based on the asset's level.

**Assets have a level that determines their bonus:**

- **Standard:** +1d6
- **Quality:** +2d6
- **Masterwork:** +3d6

The bonus corresponds to the asset's level, unless the asset has a specific description that states otherwise.

| Assets Level     | Bonus | Notes                                 |
| :------------- | :---- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Standard**   | +1d6  | Common tool that enables the action.  |
| **Quality**    | +2d6  | Superior craftsmanship or technology. |
| **Masterwork** | +3d6  | Exceptional, rare, or master-crafted. |

**Assets can also hinder:** Some assets have tags that subtract dice from certain rolls (like **Heavy** armor giving -1d6 to Agility rolls). See the **Assets** chapter for details.

### 6. Situational Aspects

The GM may grant bonus dice for advantageous circumstances (e.g., high ground, surprise, perfect lighting). Players can also create **Scene Injections** through their actions or use **Narrative Injection** to establish helpful facts.

**Types of Aspects:**

- **Character Injections:** Anchors, Burdens, Assets on your sheet
- **Scene Injections:** Environmental factors created by actions (smoke grenades, barricades, tactical positioning)
- **Story Injections:** Ongoing narrative elements established through play

**When they grant dice:** Aspects grant +1d6 or +2d6 when the GM judges they create significant advantage.

| Situation                       | Bonus        |
| :------------------------------ | :----------- |
| High ground, good lighting      | +1d6         |
| Surprise, significant advantage | +1d6 to +2d6 |
| Perfect conditions              | +1d6         |
| Scene Injection (smoke, cover)  | +1d6         |
| Major tactical advantage        | +2d6         |

---

## Step 4: Roll and Count Successes

Roll all your d6s at once.

### Counting Successes

**For d6s:** Any die showing **5 or 6** counts as **1 Success**.

Compare your total Successes to the Difficulty:

| Result                     | Outcome                                     |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Successes ≥ Difficulty** | **Success.** You achieve your intent.       |
| **Successes < Difficulty** | **Failure.** You don't get what you wanted. |

That's it. No addition, no multiplication. Just count.

## The Desperation Roll

What if your Reserve is empty, no Anchors apply, no Assets help, and the GM grants nothing?

You roll your **Stat Rating** in d6s. That's it.

---

## Example of Play

**Situation:** Kira needs to shoot a fleeing target from a rooftop. It is windy, but she has a clear sightline.
**GM:** "That's Hard—4 Successes needed."

**Kira's Build:**

1.  **Approach:** Agility (Rating 3). **Starts with 3d6.**
2.  **Focus:** She needs this hit. She spends 2 Reserve points. **Adds +2d6.**
3.  **Anchor:** "Expert Marksman" (Moderate). **Adds +2d6.**
4.  **Assets:** Quality Rifle. **Adds +2d6.**
5.  **Aspect:** Clear sightline (GM grants). **Adds +1d6.**

**The Roll:** 10d6.
She rolls `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3]`.
She counts the d6s showing 5 or higher: `6, 5, 6, 5` = **4 Successes**.
**Total:** 4 Successes.

**Result:** Success. The target falls.

# Rolling and Resolution

You've built your pool. Now roll it.

## Counting Hits

Roll all your dice at once—d6s and Step Die together.

Each die showing **5 or 6** is a **Hit**.

That's it. No addition, no multiplication. Just count.

> The Step Die counts as a Hit on 5+, same as d6s. A d10 showing 7 isn't a Hit. A d12 showing 5 is.

---

## Determining Success

Compare your Hits to the Difficulty:

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Hits ≥ Difficulty | **Success** — You achieve your intent |
| Hits < Difficulty | **Failure** — You don't get what you wanted |

### Degrees of Success

Extra Hits beyond the difficulty make your success *better*:

| Margin | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| +1-2 Hits | **Solid Success** — Clean execution, maybe a small bonus |
| +3-4 Hits | **Strong Success** — Exceptional result, GM describes extra benefit |
| +5+ Hits | **Triumph** — You narrate something impressive |

The GM adjudicates what "better" means in context. In combat, it might be extra damage. In negotiation, it might be additional concessions.

### Degrees of Failure

If you fail, the margin matters less—failure is failure. But:

| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| 1-2 Hits short | **Near Miss** — You almost had it. GM may offer a cost for partial success. |
| 3+ Hits short | **Clear Failure** — It didn't work. Move on. |
| 0 Hits | **Catastrophic Failure** — GM gets a free complication (see below). |

## The Step Die: Identity in Action

Now look at your Step Die specifically.

The Step Die tells you **how** you succeeded or failed—whether your signature trait defined the moment.

### Highest in the Pool

If your Step Die rolled **higher than all your d6s**, you succeeded *as yourself*.

- Your trait was the reason this worked
- **You gain 1 IP**
- You describe how your specialty mattered

Even on failure: "I didn't make it, but anyone watching knows I'm the right person for this job."

**Example:** Kira rolls `[6, 5, 3, 2, 1]` on her d6s and `[9]` on her d10. The d10 (9) is highest. She hits the target, earns 1 IP, and describes: "The crosshairs settle. One breath out. My finger squeezes, not pulls. Fourteen years of training in one moment."

### Lowest in the Pool

If your Step Die rolled **lower than all your d6s**, you succeeded *despite yourself*.

- Luck, circumstance, or external factors carried you
- **The GM gains 1 IP**
- The GM can describe an unexpected element

**Example:** Kira rolls `[6, 5, 5, 4, 3]` on her d6s and `[2]` on her d10. The d10 is lowest. She still hits (3 Hits), but: "The shot goes wide—but a gust of wind pushes the bullet back on target. Lucky. The GM marks 1 IP."

### Tied for Highest/Lowest

If the Step Die ties with one or more d6s for highest or lowest, it counts as **neither**. No IPs change hands. The roll was competent but unremarkable.

### The Devil's Bargain: Rolling 1 or 2

If your Step Die shows **1 or 2**, something goes wrong—regardless of success.

The GM gains a **free complication**. No IP compensation. This is the inherent risk of rolling your identity.

| Step Die | Chance of 1-2 |
|----------|---------------|
| d6 | 33% |
| d8 | 25% |
| d10 | 20% |
| d12 | 17% |

**This is why mastery matters.** A d12 expert can lean into their identity with confidence. A d6 novice takes a real gamble every time.

**Example:** Kira rolls `[5, 5, 4, 3, 2]` and her d10 shows `[1]`. She succeeds (2 Hits vs. 2 Difficulty), but the GM says: "The shot hits, but the muzzle flash gives away your position. Guards are converging."

---

## Reading the Step Die: Summary

After every roll, check:

1. **Did I succeed?** (Hits ≥ Difficulty)
2. **Was Step Die highest?** → Gain 1 IP
3. **Was Step Die lowest?** → GM gains 1 IP
4. **Did Step Die show 1-2?** → GM gets free complication

These can stack. You can succeed, have your Step Die be highest (gain 1 IP), AND roll a 2 (GM gets complication). Glory and trouble in the same moment.

---

## Post-Roll Options

After seeing the result, you can spend IPs to adjust:

| Cost | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 1 IP | **Reroll Step Die** — Keep the new result (for better or worse) |
| 2 IP | **Add +1d6** — Roll it and add any Hits |
| 3 IP | **Partial Success** — On failure, achieve some of your intent; GM adds complication |

You can only spend IPs you currently have. Choose wisely.

## Example of Full Resolution

**Situation:** Marcus (Expert Infiltrator, d10 Step Die) is sneaking past guards.

**GM:** "Two guards, alert but not searching. Challenging—3 Hits."

**Marcus:** "I spend 2 Agility for 2d6. My Expert Stealth is +2d6. I'm wearing dark clothing, so +1d6 for gear. That's 5d6 plus my d10."

**Roll:** `[6, 5, 4, 2, 1]` + `[d10: 7]`

**Counting:** 6 and 5 are Hits. 7 isn't (needs 5+ on all dice). **2 Hits. Failure.**

**Step Die Check:** The d10 (7) is highest—higher than 6, 5, 4, 2, 1. Wait, is 7 higher than 6? Yes. Marcus's player gains **1 IP**.

**GM:** "You're good—very good—but one guard turns at exactly the wrong moment. He doesn't see you yet, but he's walking toward your position. You earn an IP for style, but you're not past them yet. What do you do?"

Marcus failed, but his expertise was evident. The story continues.

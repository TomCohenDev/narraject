# The Economy

Narraject isn't a game where the GM tells a story and players react. It's a negotiation. Both sides have currency. Both sides spend it.

That currency is **Injector Points (IPs)**.

---

## What Are IPs?

IPs represent narrative authority—your ability to shape the story beyond what the dice determine.

When you have IPs, you can:

- Inject facts into the fiction
- Refuse complications the GM offers
- Push your luck after a roll

When the GM has IPs, they can:

- Introduce obstacles and twists
- Activate NPC special abilities
- Raise the stakes

---

## Starting IPs

- **Players** begin each session with **2 IPs**
- **The GM** begins with IPs equal to **2 × number of players**

Unspent IPs carry over between sessions:

- Player cap: **5 IPs**
- GM cap: **10 IPs**

---

## Using Tokens

Use physical tokens—poker chips, coins, glass beads. Place them visibly on the table.

Why? Because seeing the economy changes how you play.

When the GM's pile is low, you know you have room to push. When it's high, you know complications are coming. When your pile is empty, you know accepting that next injection might be smart.

## How Players Earn IPs

| Source                    | IPs Earned | Notes                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accept a GM Injection** | +1         | The GM offers a complication                                                    |
| **Playing the GM**        | +1         | Good roleplay, clever ideas, or making the table laugh (GM discretion)          |
| **Flaw Activation**       | +1         | If a Flaw significantly hinders the party or causes a failure, the GM awards IP |
| **Advance a Story Goal**  | +1         | Completing a personal arc beat (GM discretion)                                  |

## GM Injections

A GM Injection is a complication the GM introduces. Not a punishment—an _offer_.

The GM describes something bad happening or about to happen. They offer you 1 IP to accept it. You choose.

### The Flow

```
1. GM: "The lock clicks open, but you hear footsteps behind you.
       Guards. I'm offering an Injection—1 IP if you accept."

2. Player chooses:
   → ACCEPT: "I'll take it." Gain 1 IP.
              The guards are real. Deal with them.

   → REFUSE: "I'll spend 1 IP to refuse."
              The guards aren't there. Retcon. You proceed cleanly.
```

### When to Refuse

You can only refuse if you have at least 1 IP.

Refusing isn't "cheating" the story—it's spending your narrative currency. You earned those IPs. Spend them how you want.

Refusing costs 1 IP, while accepting gains you 1 IP. It's a break-even proposition—the choice is about whether the complication is worth it for the story.

### Good Injections

**Do:**

- Complicate success: _"You hit him, but your sword gets stuck in his armor."_
- Create choices: _"The door's open, but you can only save one hostage before the bomb goes off."_
- Introduce new problems: _"You succeeded, but someone was watching."_
- Allow reaction: _"You hear footsteps approaching. What do you do?"_

**Don't:**

- Negate success: _"Actually, you missed."_
- Remove agency: _"Your character panics and runs."_
- Punish smart play: _"Because you prepared, the enemy prepared more."_
- Make the PC look incompetent: _"You trip over your own feet."_

### Injection Frequency

Target: **1 per player per session**, plus any triggered by rules (see below).

Too few injections → Economy stagnates, players hoard IPs.  
Too many injections → Players feel picked on, refuse everything.

### Free Injections (No Choice)

Sometimes the GM gets complications without offering IPs:

| Trigger                            | Result                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zero Successes on a roll**       | GM gets one complication                            |
| **Established fiction demands it** | No roll needed (you're underwater, you're drowning) |

Free injections aren't negotiations. They happen because the dice—or the situation—demand it.

---

## Player Injections

**Injections** are special, powerful abilities defined on your character sheet. You cannot improvise Injections mid-session—they must be unlocked through character progression.

### Activating an Injection

Injections are always rolled standalone (not as part of action rolls):

- **Spend 1 IP** to activate an Injection
- **Roll only the Injector Die** (no other dice)
- **On success (3+):** The Injection creates an Aspect
- **Aspect provides bonus:** +1d6 (roll 5-9) or +2d6 (roll 10+) to related future rolls

**The bonus comes from the Aspect, not directly from the Injector Die.**

You can use Injections at any moment—before, during, or after actions. You can even use them to help other players by creating Aspects that benefit them.

Each Injection has an **Injector Die** (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12) permanently assigned to it. The die size represents reliability and narrative weight, not raw power.

See **The Injector Die** chapter for complete details on how Injections work.

## The GM's IPs

The GM has an IP pool too. Symmetry matters.

### How the GM Earns IPs

The GM does not use dice or roll for IPs. They use narrative force.

GM Injections are the primary tool. When a player refuses an Injection, the GM doesn't gain IP—they simply don't lose narrative authority.

### How the GM Spends IPs

| Cost     | Effect                                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 IP** | Minor complication without offering compensation      |
| **1 IP** | Exploit a player's named Condition (see Consequences) |
| **2 IP** | Activate an NPC's special ability                     |
| **3 IP** | Introduce an unexpected enemy or obstacle             |
| **4 IP** | Reveal a hidden connection or betrayal                |
| **5 IP** | Dramatically change the stakes of a scene             |

### Limits

- The GM **cannot** spend IPs to negate player Injections
- The GM **must** announce IP spending before players roll
- No "gotcha" moments—the economy is visible

## Spending IPs

You can spend IPs for:

| Cost                 | Effect                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 IP**             | **Activate an Injection** — Add the Injector Die to a roll (see **The Injector Die** chapter) |
| **Between Sessions** | **Advancement** — Spend IP like XP to:                                                        |
|                      | • Level up Traits (Basic → Advanced → Master)                                                 |
|                      | • Step up Injector Dice (d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12)                                            |
|                      | • Unlock new Injections                                                                       |
| **Variable**         | **Gear/Story** — Secure assets or make temporary items permanent                              |

You can only spend IPs you currently have. Choose wisely.

## Economy Health

At session's end, assess:

**Healthy signs:**

- IPs changed hands often
- Players accepted most injections
- Players made meaningful injections
- GM pile fluctuated

**Warning signs:**

- Players refused every injection (too harsh?)
- Players hoarded IPs (nothing worth buying?)
- One player has 5, others have 0 (redistribution failing?)
- GM never spent IPs (not engaging the economy)

Adjust accordingly. The economy should _flow_.

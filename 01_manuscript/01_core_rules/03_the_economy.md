# The Economy: Narrative Points

Narraject uses **Narrative Points (NP)** as a currency for character progression. You earn NP through exceptional play, and spend them to advance your character mechanically and narratively.

---

## What Are Narrative Points?

Narrative Points represent your character's growth through experience, training, and personal development. They're not spent during play—they're invested between sessions (or during downtime) to improve your character.

**NP is for progression only.** You don't spend NP to activate abilities, reroll dice, or gain tactical advantages during play. For in-the-moment tactical options, you spend **Effort** from your stat Reserves.

---

## Earning Narrative Points

NP is awarded by the GM or through group consensus when players engage meaningfully with the narrative.

### How to Earn NP

You earn **1 NP** when you:
- Play a Burden in a way that creates compelling drama or complications
- Use your Narrative Injection creatively and meaningfully
- Create a "holy shit" story moment that makes the table lean in
- Drive the narrative forward through roleplay, tactics, or storytelling
- Achieve a Story Goal or personal character milestone
- Demonstrate exceptional play that enriches the session

**Important:** NP is awarded for **engaging with the system**, not just for having Burdens or using mechanics. You must actively create interesting story moments.

### Who Can Award NP?

**Option 1: GM Awards (Simple)**
- The GM awards NP when they see great play
- Fast, straightforward, but less collaborative

**Option 2: Group Recognition (Collaborative)**
- Any player can nominate another player for NP
- Table consensus or GM approval finalizes the award
- Encourages group engagement and recognition

**Option 3: Hybrid (Recommended)**
- GM can award NP directly for exceptional moments
- Players can nominate each other with GM approval
- Combines speed with collaboration

---

## NP Distribution Guidelines

Different tables have different pacing needs. The GM chooses the distribution model that fits their campaign:

### Model 1: Capped Per Player (Recommended)
- Each player can earn **up to 2 NP per session**
- If all players earn at least 1 NP, everyone gets a bonus +1 NP
- Encourages everyone to engage

### Model 2: Shared Pool
- **6 total NP per session** to distribute among the group
- Each player can only receive up to 2 NP
- Encourages tactical distribution to those who need it

### Model 3: Round Robin
- First "round": everyone can get 1 NP
- Only after everyone has 1 NP, players can get their 2nd
- If everyone gets 2 NP, bonus round unlocks
- Ensures everyone gets rewarded before anyone gets seconds

### Model 4: Uncapped (For Experienced Groups)
- No limits on NP awards
- Risk of imbalance, but rewards consistent excellence
- Progression costs may need to scale

**For new groups:** Start with Model 1. It balances fairness with reward.

## Spending Narrative Points

NP is spent **between sessions** or during **in-game downtime** to advance your character.

### Progression Costs

| Advancement                              | NP Cost | Notes                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Upgrade Anchor (Basic → Advanced)**    | 2 NP    | Requires narrative justification          |
| **Upgrade Anchor (Advanced → Master)**   | 3 NP    | Requires significant narrative moment     |
| **Add New Basic Anchor**                 | 2 NP    | Explain how you learned this              |
| **Add New Advanced Anchor**              | 4 NP    | Justify why you'd start at this level     |
| **Reduce Burden Severity (-3d6 → -2d6)** | 3 NP    | Requires narrative resolution             |
| **Remove Minor Burden (-1d6)**           | 3 NP    | Story must meaningfully address this      |
| **Increase Stat Rating**                 | 3 NP    | Represents deep training, max Rating 5    |
| **Unlock Setting Ability** (future)      | Varies  | Per setting package (magic, psionics, etc.) |

### Narrative Justification Required

You can't just spend NP and claim advancement. You must narrate how your character earned it.

**Examples:**

**Upgrading an Anchor:**
- "During our downtime, I trained with the veteran soldier. I'm upgrading my Combat Training from Basic → Advanced."
- "After nearly dying in that fire, I've faced my fear. I'm reducing my 'Fear of Fire' Burden from -2d6 → -1d6."

**Adding a New Anchor:**
- "I've been studying the ancient texts we found. I'm adding 'Ancient History' as a Basic Anchor."
- "After working with the hacker for three missions, I've picked up some skills. I'm adding 'Basic Hacking' as an Anchor."

**Removing a Burden:**
- "I reconciled with my sister. The 'Estranged Family' Burden no longer applies."
- "After months of therapy and facing my trauma, I'm removing my 'PTSD' Burden."

**The Rule:** The narrative must make sense for the advancement. GMs can reject advancements that lack proper narrative grounding.

---

## NP Cap: Use It or Lose It

You can store **up to 5 NP at a time**. Once you hit the cap, you stop earning NP until you spend some.

**Why cap NP?**
- Forces players to invest in their characters
- Prevents infinite hoarding
- Creates meaningful progression choices
- "Use it or lose it" encourages engagement

**When you hit 5 NP:** Spend at least some NP before the next session, or you won't earn more.

---

## Milestone Advancement (Optional)

GMs can grant **milestone advancements** independent of NP:

- Completing major story arcs
- Defeating significant threats
- Achieving personal character goals
- Surviving epic challenges

**Milestone rewards can be:**
- Free Anchor upgrade (no NP cost)
- Bonus NP (beyond session cap)
- Unlocking unique abilities
- Narrative advancements (reputation, titles, resources)

Milestones are in addition to normal NP progression. Use them sparingly for truly epic moments.

## Example: Earning and Spending NP

### Session 1: Earning NP

**Scene:** The party is infiltrating a corporate gala. Marcus (the Face) has a Burden: "Sister (Kara) thinks I'm dead."

**GM:** "As you scan the room, you see her. Kara. Your sister. She's talking to the CEO—the man you're here to rob."

**Marcus:** "Oh no. I freeze. She can't see me. But I need to get to the CEO."

**Marcus makes a Persona roll to stay calm, takes -1d6 from distraction. He barely succeeds, gets the data, but Kara almost sees him. He escapes by inches.**

**GM:** "That was tense. Marcus, you played your Burden beautifully and created real drama. You earn 1 NP."

**Later in the session, Marcus uses his Narrative Injection:**

**Marcus:** "I inject this: One of the security guards is an old contact from my street days. I try to convince him to let us through."

**GM creates a quick NPC, Marcus roleplays the scene, and it adds depth to the heist.**

**GM:** "That Narrative Injection created a great moment and added texture to the world. That's another 1 NP."

**End of session:** Marcus has earned 2 NP (the session cap).

---

### Between Sessions: Spending NP

**Marcus (to GM):** "I want to spend my 2 NP. During downtime, I've been thinking about Kara. Seeing her reminded me of my old life. I want to add a new Anchor: 'Corporate Insider Knowledge (Basic)' — I grew up around that world because of her."

**GM:** "I love it. That makes perfect sense narratively. You spend 2 NP, you now have 'Corporate Insider Knowledge (Basic)' as an Anchor. +1d6 when dealing with corporate culture."

**Marcus now has 0 NP and is ready to earn more next session.**

---

## Narrative Points and Burdens

When you take a new Anchor (especially Advanced or Master), you must also balance it with a Burden. See the **Rule of Balance** in the Anchors and Burdens chapters.

**Example:** You spend 4 NP to add "Master Swordsman (Advanced)" as an Anchor. You must also add or deepen a Burden:
- Add a new Burden: "Rival Duelist (narrative complication)"
- Deepen an existing Burden: "Arrogant" goes from -1d6 → -2d6

This keeps characters balanced and ensures new power comes with new complications.

---

## NP and Setting Packages (Future)

When setting-specific rules are introduced (magic systems, cybernetics, psionics), they will have their own NP costs and requirements:

**Example (Magical Abilities - Future Content):**
- Unlock Basic Spell: 2 NP + narrative explanation
- Upgrade Spell Potency: 3 NP
- Unlock Advanced School of Magic: 5 NP + in-game training

These systems will be modular—GMs can add them or ignore them based on their campaign.

**For now:** Core rules don't include setting-specific abilities. They'll be added as expansions.

---

## GM Guidance: Awarding NP

### When to Award NP

✅ **Award NP when:**
- A player creates a memorable story moment
- A Burden is played in a way that deepens the narrative
- Narrative Injection is used creatively (not just mechanically)
- Roleplay drives the session forward
- The table reacts with genuine excitement or emotion

❌ **Don't award NP for:**
- Just using game mechanics (everyone rolls dice)
- Showing up to the session (that's baseline)
- Having Burdens on your sheet (playing them matters, not having them)
- Doing cool tactical moves without narrative depth

### Balancing Awards

- Aim for **1-2 NP per player per session** as baseline
- If one player dominates, encourage others
- If someone's struggling, ask what would help them engage
- NP should feel earned, not given

### Dealing with NP Hoarding

If players are hitting the 5 NP cap and not spending:
- Remind them: "Use it or you can't earn more"
- Offer clear advancement opportunities during downtime
- Ask: "What does your character want to improve?"

---

## Quick Reference

**Earning NP:** Play Burdens well, use Narrative Injection creatively, create story moments, achieve goals

**Award Amount:** 1 NP per worthy moment

**Session Cap (Recommended):** 2 NP per player per session, +1 bonus if everyone earns at least 1

**NP Cap:** Maximum 5 NP stored

**Spending NP:** Between sessions or during downtime, with narrative justification

**Costs:** 2-4 NP for most advancements

**Rule of Balance:** New Anchors require new or deepened Burdens

---

## Final Thought

Narrative Points aren't just XP by another name. They're a reward system that encourages players to engage with the narrative—to play their Burdens, use their tools creatively, and create moments that make the story memorable.

**Don't hoard them. Spend them. Grow your character. Make them legendary.**

# Narrative Injection

**Narrative Injection** is your ability—once per session—to inject a story element, context, or fact into the narrative at any moment. It's your chance to rewrite reality, add crucial context, or create opportunities that didn't exist before.

---

## What Is Narrative Injection?

Each player has **one Narrative Injection per session**. Think of it as your "story authorship token"—your chance to inject yourself into the narrative beyond what the dice allow.

**You can use it:**
- Before a roll to establish helpful context
- After a roll to reframe the outcome
- After a failure to introduce a complication that changes the situation
- Between scenes to establish facts about the world
- During combat to reveal a crucial detail
- At any dramatic moment to create a "holy shit" twist

**The key:** It must correlate to your character's background, the ongoing story, or make narrative sense. The GM can veto if it's too meta, not interesting, or overpowered—but good GMs will say yes to creative, story-driven injections.

---

## How It Works

### The Flow

1. **Declare Your Injection:** Describe the story element you want to inject
2. **GM Evaluates:** The GM decides if it's reasonable and interesting
3. **Reality Changes:** If approved, the injection becomes truth

### No Roll Required

Narrative Injections don't require dice rolls. They're pure narrative authority. If the GM approves, it happens.

### No Cost (Usually)

Narrative Injections are free to use—you get one per session automatically. Some GMs may grant additional Injections for exceptional play, but the baseline is **one per player per session**.

## When to Use It

**Desperate Situations**
- A character is near death, and you inject: "I know a herbalist not far from here who can help."
- Your enemy has you cornered, and you inject: "Actually, this is the alley where I grew up—I know every escape route."

**Creating Opportunities**
- Before a social roll: "One of the cult members is an old friend I haven't seen in years. I try to convince them to switch sides."
- During investigation: "I remember reading about this symbol in an ancient text. It's the mark of the Shadowhand Guild."

**Reframing Failure**
- After missing a shot: "The bullet ricochets and hits the control panel, causing chaos."
- After failed persuasion: "My argument fails, but it catches the attention of someone else in the room who agrees with me."

**Establishing Facts**
- "My character has a safe house in this city."
- "I've dealt with this crime boss before—we have history."
- "I prepared for this exact scenario. I have flashbang grenades in my coat."

## Examples of Play

### Example 1: The Herbalist

**Situation:** After a brutal fight, the party's tank is on the brink of death. No one has medical supplies.

**Player:** "Wait. My ranger background—I spent years in these woods. I use my Narrative Injection: There's an old herbalist who lives nearby. I know where to find them."

**GM:** "That's perfect. Yes. You remember old Marta—she lives about a mile north in a hidden grove. You've traded with her before."

**Result:** The party has a new objective: reach Marta before their friend bleeds out. Tension maintained, but hope introduced.

---

### Example 2: The Old Friend

**Situation:** The party is ambushed by cultists. The fight is going badly.

**Player:** "I use my Narrative Injection. One of these cultists—the one with the red hood—he's Marcus, my childhood friend who disappeared five years ago. I shout his name."

**GM:** "Amazing. Yes. Marcus freezes mid-swing. He recognizes you. His eyes widen."

**Player:** "Marcus! What are you doing? It's me!"

**GM:** "The other cultists don't stop, but Marcus hesitates. You have a chance to talk to him. Roll Persona to convince him to stand down."

**Result:** Combat dynamic shifts. One enemy becomes a potential ally. Narrative tension increases.

---

### Example 3: The Prepared Operative

**Situation:** The party is trapped in a burning building. No obvious exits.

**Player:** "I use my Narrative Injection. My character is a former corporate infiltrator—I always prepare escape routes. I studied the blueprints of this building before we came here. There's a maintenance shaft behind that panel."

**GM:** "You studied the building? Why?"

**Player:** "Because I never trust a single exit. It's paranoia from my old job—always have a backup."

**GM:** "I love it. Yes. You pry off the panel and there's the shaft, exactly where you said. It's tight, but you can fit."

**Result:** Problem solved through character backstory, not dice. The Injection created a solution that made narrative sense.

---

### Example 4: Reframing Failure

**Situation:** The hacker tries to disable the security system. Rolls terribly. Fails.

**Player:** "Can I use my Narrative Injection to reframe this?"

**GM:** "Go for it."

**Player:** "I failed to disable the alarms quietly, but in the process, I accidentally triggered a system-wide diagnostic. Every camera in the building is offline for 30 seconds while the system reboots. We have a small window."

**GM:** "That's brilliant. Yes. Alarms are blaring, but the cameras are dark. You have 30 seconds of chaos. Go."

**Result:** Failure becomes a different kind of success. The situation changes, but tension remains.

## What Makes a Good Injection?

### ✅ Good Injections

- **Connect to your character:** "As an ex-military medic, I know field triage techniques."
- **Add complications, not just solutions:** "I know a contact here, but they hate me for what I did."
- **Create drama:** "That guard? He's my brother. I thought he was dead."
- **Make the story more interesting:** "I've been here before—this is where I lost my team."

### ❌ Bad Injections

- **Too convenient:** "I have a rocket launcher in my pocket."
- **No narrative grounding:** "Suddenly, aliens appear and solve our problem."
- **Removes all stakes:** "Actually, none of this matters because I'm invincible."
- **No connection to character or story:** "A dragon appears and kills everyone."

---

## GM Guidance: When to Say Yes

Say **YES** when the Injection:
- Connects to the character's background or established story
- Makes the scene more interesting
- Creates new complications or opportunities
- Respects the table's tone and established fiction

Say **NO** (or negotiate) when the Injection:
- Breaks established fiction or contradicts known facts
- Removes all tension or stakes
- Is too meta or disconnected from the narrative
- Would trivialize important challenges without earning it

**Pro Tip:** If you want to say no, offer an alternative: "Not a rocket launcher, but maybe a flare gun you grabbed earlier?"

---

## Tracking Narrative Injections

**On Your Character Sheet:**
```
NARRATIVE INJECTION
□ Available (1 per session)
```

At the start of each session, reset the checkbox. You have one Narrative Injection ready.

Some GMs may grant bonus Injections for exceptional play, milestone achievements, or dramatic moments. This is at GM discretion.

## Narrative Injections and Aspects

Narrative Injections can create **Scene Injections** or **Story Injections** (see The Roll for Aspect types):

**Scene Injection Example:**
- You inject: "There's a chandelier above the enemy."
- This creates a Scene Injection: **"Chandelier overhead"**
- You or allies can use it narratively (cut the chain to drop it) or it might grant +1d6 to related actions

**Story Injection Example:**
- You inject: "I have a contact in the thieves' guild who owes me a favor."
- This creates a Story Injection that lasts beyond the current scene
- The contact becomes a recurring NPC the GM can use

Narrative Injections don't automatically grant bonus dice unless they create advantageous circumstances that the GM would normally grant dice for.

---

## Why Only One Per Session?

Narrative Injections are powerful. They bypass dice, rewrite reality, and give players authorship. If unlimited, they would undermine the GM's role and reduce tension.

**One per session means:**
- You save it for moments that matter
- You don't spam reality-warping every scene
- When you use it, it feels significant
- Other players also get their moment to shine

**No reason not to use it:** Your Injection resets each session. If you never use it, you're wasting a powerful tool. Find the moment where it matters most, then inject your story.

---

## Final Thought

Narrative Injection is your invitation to co-author the story. It's not about "winning" or bypassing challenges—it's about creating moments that make everyone at the table lean forward and say, "Oh, that's good."

Use it wisely. Use it boldly. Use it to make the story unforgettable.

# The Ladder: Ambition vs Difficulty

This is the most important rule in Narraject:

**If you succeed on the roll, your Intent happens. Period.**

There is no "you hit him but didn't do enough damage." There is no "you persuaded him but he still won't do it." If the dice say success, the reality you described becomes true.

## The Trade-off: Ambition Sets Difficulty

Because success guarantees the outcome, the _ambition_ of your intent sets the Difficulty.

- **"I want to distract the dragon by throwing a rock."**
  - **Difficulty:** Moderate (2 Marks).
  - **Success:** The dragon looks away for a moment.

- **"I want to kill the dragon instantly by throwing a fork into its eye."**
  - **Difficulty:** Legendary (10 Marks).
  - **Success:** The fork pierces the brain. The dragon dies.

You can attempt anything—even killing a dragon with a fork. The GM will never say "you can't try." They will simply set the Difficulty to match the impossibility of the task. If you can build a pool big enough to hit 10 Marks, then yes, you kill the dragon with a fork.

## Balancing Risk and Reward

You choose your own difficulty by choosing your intent.

- **Safe Intent:** "I slash at the bandit's torso to drive him back."
  - **Difficulty:** Moderate (2 Marks).
  - **Outcome:** He retreats, but is still alive and fighting.

- **Risky Intent:** "I slash at his neck to take his head off."
  - **Difficulty:** Hard (4 Marks).
  - **Outcome:** He is dead instantly.

- **Creative Intent:** "I persuade the King to give us the army... by performing a perfect ancestral dance."
  - **Difficulty:** Very Hard (5 Marks) because it's an unconventional approach.
  - **Outcome:** The King is moved to tears and grants you the army.

Be specific. Be ambitious. Be creative. But remember: the bigger the request, the harder the roll.

## Degrees of Success

Extra Marks beyond the difficulty make your success _better_:

| Margin     | Effect                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| +1-2 Marks | **Solid Success** — Clean execution, maybe a small bonus            |
| +3-4 Marks | **Strong Success** — Exceptional result, GM describes extra benefit |
| +5+ Marks  | **Triumph** — You narrate something impressive                      |

The GM adjudicates what "better" means in context. In combat, it might be extra damage. In negotiation, it might be additional concessions.

## Degrees of Failure

If you fail, the margin matters less—failure is failure. But:

| Result          | Effect                                                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 Marks short | **Near Miss** — You almost had it. GM may offer a cost for partial success. |
| 3+ Marks short  | **Clear Failure** — It didn't work. Move on.                                |
| 0 Marks         | **Catastrophic Failure** — GM gets a free complication (see below).         |

## The GM's Job

When a player declares intent, the GM has one job: set the Difficulty that matches the ambition.

**Don't say:** "You can't kill a dragon with a fork."

**Do say:** "That's Legendary—10 Marks. If you succeed, the fork pierces its eye and kills it instantly."

The player can then decide: do I want to try for 10 Marks, or do I want to aim for something more achievable?

This creates meaningful choices. Players choose their own risk level by choosing their ambition.

## Examples

**Combat:**
- "I want to hurt them" → Moderate (2 Marks) → Hurt Condition
- "I want to wound them" → Hard (4 Marks) → Wounded Condition
- "I want to kill them" → Very Hard (5 Marks) → Critical Condition

**Social:**
- "I want to get past the guard" → Moderate (2 Marks) → He lets you through
- "I want to turn the guard into an ally" → Hard (4 Marks) → He's now on your side
- "I want to turn the entire garrison against their commander" → Heroic (7 Marks) → Mutiny begins

**Exploration:**
- "I want to find a way in" → Moderate (2 Marks) → You find an entrance
- "I want to find the secret passage the architect built" → Hard (4 Marks) → You find the hidden route
- "I want to find the architect's hidden vault with all his blueprints" → Very Hard (5 Marks) → You discover the vault

The pattern is clear: bigger ambition = higher Difficulty. But if you succeed, you get exactly what you asked for.

## The Golden Rule

**Success = Intent Happens. Period.**

This rule makes every roll meaningful. You're not just rolling to see if you can try—you're rolling to see if you succeed at exactly what you described.

Use it. Trust it. It makes the game better.

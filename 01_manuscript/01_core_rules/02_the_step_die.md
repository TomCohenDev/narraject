# The Step Die

The Step Die is the star of Narraject. It doesn't just add to your pool—it tells you _how_ you succeeded or failed.

---

## Reading the Step Die

**Important:** Reading the Step Die is separate from counting Marks. You do both, but they answer different questions:

- **Marks** answer: "Did I succeed?"
- **Step Die** answers: "Did I succeed _as myself_?"

After counting Marks, look at your Step Die specifically. Compare its _face value_ to all your d6s.

---

## Highest in the Pool

If your Step Die rolled **higher than all your d6s**, you succeeded _as yourself_.

- Your trait was the reason this worked
- **You gain 1 IP**
- You describe how your specialty mattered

Even on failure: "I didn't make it, but anyone watching knows I'm the right person for this job."

**Example:** Kira rolls `[6, 5, 3, 2, 1]` on her d6s and `[9]` on her d10. She gets 2 Marks (6 and 5). The d10 (9) is highest. Even if she failed, she earns 1 IP and describes: "The crosshairs settle. One breath out. My finger squeezes, not pulls. Fourteen years of training in one moment."

---

## Lowest in the Pool

If your Step Die rolled **lower than all your d6s**, you succeeded _despite yourself_.

- Luck, circumstance, or external factors carried you
- **The GM gains 1 IP**
- The GM can describe an unexpected element

**Example:** Kira rolls `[6, 5, 5, 4, 3]` on her d6s and `[2]` on her d10. She gets 3 Marks and succeeds. But the d10 (2) is lowest. "The shot goes wide—but a gust of wind pushes the bullet back on target. Lucky." The GM marks 1 IP.

---

## Tied for Highest/Lowest

If the Step Die ties with one or more d6s for highest or lowest, it counts as **neither**. No IPs change hands. The roll was competent but unremarkable.

---

## The Devil's Bargain: Rolling 1 or 2

If your Step Die shows **1 or 2**, something goes wrong—regardless of success.

The GM gains a **free complication**. No IP compensation. This is the inherent risk of rolling your identity.

| Step Die | Chance of 1-2 |
| -------- | ------------- |
| d6       | 33%           |
| d8       | 25%           |
| d10      | 20%           |
| d12      | 17%           |

**This is why mastery matters.** A d12 expert can lean into their identity with confidence. A d6 novice takes a real gamble every time.

**Example:** Kira rolls `[5, 5, 4, 3, 2]` and her d10 shows `[1]`. She succeeds (2 Marks vs. 2 Difficulty), but the GM says: "The shot hits, but the muzzle flash gives away your position. Guards are converging."

---

## Step Die Progression

Your Step Die comes from your **Focus** or most relevant trained specialty:

| Level               | Step Die |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Untrained / Generic | d6       |
| Trained             | d8       |
| Expert              | d10      |
| Master              | d12      |

If no specific Focus or specialty applies, roll a d6—representing basic competence.

> **Critical:** Only ONE Step Die per roll. If multiple specialties could apply, choose the highest—but that specialty defines your approach.

---

## Step Die Probability

Since 5+ is a Mark on any die, bigger Step Dice contribute more:

| Step Die | Mark Chance | Chance of 1-2 (Complication) |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| d6       | 33%         | 33%                          |
| d8       | 50%         | 25%                          |
| d10      | 60%         | 20%                          |
| d12      | 67%         | 17%                          |

This means mastery is triple good:

1. More likely to contribute Marks (succeed)
2. More likely to be highest (earn IP)
3. Less likely to roll 1-2 (avoid complications)

A d12 Master isn't just "better"—they're reliable in every dimension.

---

## Reading the Step Die: Summary

After every roll, check in this order:

1. **Did I succeed?** (Marks ≥ Difficulty)
2. **Was Step Die highest?** → Gain 1 IP
3. **Was Step Die lowest?** → GM gains 1 IP
4. **Did Step Die show 1-2?** → GM gets free complication

These can stack. You can succeed, have your Step Die be highest (gain 1 IP), AND roll a 2 (GM gets complication). Glory and trouble in the same moment.

## Edge Cases

### What Counts as Highest/Lowest?

Compare the _face value_ of the Step Die to the _face values_ of all d6s. A d10 showing 7 is higher than a d6 showing 6.

### No Relevant Focus

If no specialty applies, your Step Die is a d6. It can still be highest or lowest—it's just less likely to stand out.

### Multiple Characters Helping

One character rolls as primary. Others can spend 1 point from a relevant stat's Reserve to add +1d6 to the pool (max +2d6 from assistance). Only the primary roller's Step Die matters.

### Tied Results

If Step Die ties for highest or lowest with any d6, it counts as neither. No IP movement.

| Step Die Result   | Effect                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |

| Lowest in pool    | +1 IP to GM                |
| Shows 1-2         | GM gets free complication |
| Ties for position | No effect                 |

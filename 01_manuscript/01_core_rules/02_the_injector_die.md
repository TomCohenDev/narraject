# The Injector Die

The **Injector Die** is rolled when you spend **1 IP** to activate a specific **Injection** from your character sheet. Injections are always used as standalone narrative tools—they are never added to your dice pool.

---

## What Is an Injection?

An **Injection** is a special, powerful ability defined on your character sheet. You cannot improvise Injections mid-session—they must be unlocked through character progression.

Each Injection on your sheet has:

- **A name and description** of what it does
- **An Injector Die** (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12) permanently assigned to it

---

## The Injector Die Sizes

The Injector Die can be d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12. Each Injection on your sheet has exactly one die size assigned to it.

**What the Size Means:**

The die size represents **Reliability** and **Narrative Weight**, not raw power.

- **d12 Injection:** You put your d12 on an Injection you want to _guarantee_ works or rely upon heavily. It's your safest, most reliable ability.
- **d4 Injection:** You put a d4 on an Injection you view as volatile, risky, or minor. It's powerful but unreliable.

> **Note:** A d12 Injection is not necessarily "stronger" than a d4. The size determines how _safe_ it is to use, not the magnitude of the effect.

## Using Injections

Injections are always used as **standalone narrative tools**. You never add the Injector Die to an action roll.

### How to Use an Injection

1. **Declare the Injection** from your character sheet.
2. **Spend 1 IP** (Injector Point).
3. **Roll only the Injector Die** (no other dice).
4. **Resolve the result:**
   - **Roll 3+:** The Injection **Succeeds**. The narrative effect happens.
   - **Roll 1-2:** The Injection **Fails**. The effect does not occur.

### When to Use Injections

You can use Injections at any moment:

- **Before an action** to create an Aspect that helps your roll
- **After an action** to explain success or create ongoing benefits
- **Between scenes** to establish facts, relationships, or conditions
- **To help other players** by creating Aspects that benefit them
- **As actions themselves** when the Injection's effect is the primary goal

---

## Creating Aspects

When an Injection succeeds, it usually creates an **Aspect**—a beneficial condition, relationship, or fact that can add dice to future related rolls.

**Aspect Strength Based on Injector Die Roll:**

- **Roll 5-9:** Creates a **Minor Aspect** (+1d6 to related future rolls)
- **Roll 10+:** Creates a **Significant Aspect** (+2d6 to related future rolls)

The GM determines what kind of Aspect is created and how long it lasts, based on the Injection's description and the situation.

**Aspect Duration:**

- **Minor Aspects (5-9):** Typically last for the current scene
- **Significant Aspects (10+):** Typically last for the rest of the session, or until the situation changes

---

## Resolving the Injector Die

When you roll your Injector Die, you resolve it as follows:

**Success Check:**

- **Roll 3+:** The Injection **Succeeds**. The narrative effect happens (usually creating an Aspect).
- **Roll 1-2:** The Injection **Fails**. The effect does not occur.

**Aspect Strength (if succeeded):**

- **Roll 5-9:** Minor Aspect (+1d6 to related rolls)
- **Roll 10+:** Significant Aspect (+2d6 to related rolls)

## Example of Play: Before an Action

**Character:** "The Sniper"

- **Injection:** _Ricochet Shot_ (Assigned Die: **d8**).
  - _Effect:_ The bullet ricochets to hit a secondary target behind cover.

**The Scene:** An enemy is hiding behind a wall. The player wants to hit them.

1. **Player:** "I want to use _Ricochet Shot_ before I take the shot to set up the ricochet angle."
2. **GM:** "That's a standalone Injection. Spend 1 IP and roll your Injector Die."
3. **The Roll:**
   - d8 (Injector): `7`.
4. **The Result:**
   - **Roll 7:** The Injection succeeds (3+), and creates a Minor Aspect (5-9).
   - **Narrative:** You identify the perfect ricochet angle off the wall. You gain the Aspect **"Perfect Ricochet Angle"** (+1d6 to the next shot attempt).
5. **Next Action:** When you make the actual shot roll, you can add +1d6 from the Aspect.

## Example of Play: Helping Another Player

**Character:** "The Face"

- **Injection:** _Old Contacts_ (Assigned Die: **d10**).
  - _Effect:_ You establish a useful connection or relationship.

**The Scene:** Another player is trying to gather information about a criminal organization.

1. **Player (The Face):** "I want to use _Old Contacts_ to help Marcus gather info. I'll reach out to an old contact."
2. **GM:** "That's a standalone Injection. Spend 1 IP and roll your Injector Die."
3. **The Roll:**
   - d10 (Injector): `11`.
4. **The Result:**
   - **Roll 11:** The Injection succeeds (3+), and creates a Significant Aspect (10+).
   - **Narrative:** You reach out to an old contact who not only knows about the organization but owes you a favor. They're willing to help. Marcus gains the Aspect **"Helpful Informant"** (+2d6 to related information gathering rolls for the rest of the session).
5. **Future Use:** Marcus can use the +2d6 from this Aspect when making Persona or Mind rolls to gather information related to this organization.

## Example of Play: As the Action Itself

**Character:** "The Tech"

- **Injection:** _Remote Hack_ (Assigned Die: **d8**).
  - _Effect:_ You hack into a system remotely and disable it.

**The Scene:** The party needs to disable security cameras.

1. **Player:** "I want to use _Remote Hack_ to disable the cameras."
2. **GM:** "That's a standalone Injection. Spend 1 IP and roll your Injector Die."
3. **The Roll:**
   - d8 (Injector): `6`.
4. **The Result:**
   - **Roll 6:** The Injection succeeds (3+), and creates a Minor Aspect (5-9).
   - **Narrative:** You successfully hack the cameras and disable them. Additionally, you've identified a vulnerability in their system, creating the Aspect **"System Vulnerability"** (+1d6 to future hacking rolls against this security system for the scene).

## Core Concerns: Anchors, Burdens, and Narrative Flow

I'm contemplating how Anchors and Burdens interact with the game's flow. Currently, Aspects can be invoked whenever they're relevant and create drama. Right now they just grant +Xd6 to rolls, while Burdens do the opposite. When a player creates an epic moment through Aspect narration, they earn NP (Narrative Points). NP is currently used to upgrade Anchors, lessen Burdens, or create new Anchors. NP can also be traded for Focus points, which add instant successes AFTER rolls. I love that idea.

Originally, I wanted NP to be the resource for Path abilities and character powers.

### Issues I'm Running Into:

**Path Abilities Don't Click**
- Path abilities don't work well with the core ruleset. Since the game is light on rules, abilities need to affect narration directly. Something just doesn't click there.

**NP Does Too Many Things**
- NP seems to be the core resource and is used for many things. I'm still not sure if I like that, since NP will be the main source of power for players.

**Too Many Modifiers to Track**
- Rolls can be affected by Anchors, Burdens, Gear, Stats, AND Aspects. From personal experience, using Aspects that always apply is hard to track. Gear that always applies +1d6 is hard to remember. Always invoking Anchors becomes spammy and unbalanced.
- Anchors and Burdens need to change in their gameplay mechanics—perhaps even in their meanings.

**Damage Scaling Problems**
- I've been told the chance of getting one-hit killed by a Level 5 enemy is too high. If I attack them and get 0 successes, that's 5 damage—meaning I immediately take one Condition plus 1 Stress, putting me close to a second Condition. Damage rules need to change OR enemies need set damage for scaling purposes. Technically, players can use Focus to get more successes and reduce damage taken, but the math feels punishing.

**Aspects Need Invocation Tracking**
- Even scene Aspects need some kind of invocation mechanic, so it's easy to track what's relevant. Otherwise, MANY Aspects can be used at once, making tracking impossible.

### Possible Solutions (and New Problems)

**Remove Anchor/Burden Bonuses?**
- My first thought is to remove dice bonuses from Anchors and Burdens and just allow them to grant NP when invoked. But that doesn't solve the spamming issue. Also, how do you balance Anchors and Burdens when they can be anything at all? Some players might earn MUCH more NP than others. If I cap NP, I hurt progression—because I want NP to be used and gained a lot during sessions so players can use their cool Framework Path abilities.

**Gear Should Always Apply**
	- Some Aspects, like gear, should always be active. There's no reason to invoke armor—if I'm attacked and I have armor, I should be safer. Period.

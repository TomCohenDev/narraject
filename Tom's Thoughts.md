# Tom's Thoughts

## **Date:** 2026-01-16

I'm contemplating how Anchors and Burdens interact with the game's flow. Currently, Aspects can be invoked whenever they're relevant and create drama. Right now they just grant +Xd6 to rolls, while Burdens do the opposite. When a player creates an epic moment through Aspect narration, they earn NP (Narrative Points). NP is currently used to upgrade Anchors, lessen Burdens, or create new Anchors. NP can also be traded for Focus points, which add instant successes AFTER rolls. I love that idea.

Originally, I wanted NP to be the resource for Path abilities and character powers.

### Issues I'm Running Into:

**Path Abilities Don't Click**
- Path abilities don't work well with the core ruleset. Since the game is light on rules, abilities need to affect narration directly. Something just doesn't click there.

**NP Does Too Many Things**
- NP seems to be the core resource and is used for many things. I'm still not sure if I like that, since NP will be the main source of power for players.

**Too Many Modifiers to Track**
- Rolls can be affected by Anchors, Burdens, Gear, Stats, AND Aspects. From personal experience, using Aspects that always apply is hard to track. Gear that always applies +1d6 is hard to remember. Always invoking Anchors becomes spammy and unbalanced.
- Anchors and Burdens need to change in their gameplay mechanics—perhaps even in their meanings.

**Damage Scaling Problems**
- I've been told the chance of getting one-hit killed by a Level 5 enemy is too high. If I attack them and get 0 successes, that's 5 damage—meaning I immediately take one Condition plus 1 Stress, putting me close to a second Condition. Damage rules need to change OR enemies need set damage for scaling purposes. Technically, players can use Focus to get more successes and reduce damage taken, but the math feels punishing.

**Aspects Need Invocation Tracking**
- Even scene Aspects need some kind of invocation mechanic, so it's easy to track what's relevant. Otherwise, MANY Aspects can be used at once, making tracking impossible.

### Possible Solutions (and New Problems)

**Remove Anchor/Burden Bonuses?**
- My first thought is to remove dice bonuses from Anchors and Burdens and just allow them to grant NP when invoked. But that doesn't solve the spamming issue. Also, how do you balance Anchors and Burdens when they can be anything at all? Some players might earn MUCH more NP than others. If I cap NP, I hurt progression—because I want NP to be used and gained a lot during sessions so players can use their cool Framework Path abilities.

**Gear Should Always Apply**
	- Some Aspects, like gear, should always be active. There's no reason to invoke armor—if I'm attacked and I have armor, I should be safer. Period.

Lets play test gear adding impact instead of dice 
- **Stats:** Base dice (1-5).
    
- **Anchors:** Skill dice (+1 or +2).
    
- **Aspects:** Advantage dice (+1 per relevant Aspect).

so lets say i have a character with 
Stats
MIGHT 4, AGILITY 3, MIND 3, PERSONA 2 
Gear: 
a sword, armor, quick crossbow in my arm with one shot loaded, 
Anchors:
master swordsman
know people in the council

i go and attack someone LEVEL 2 with no special stats

i say:
i attack the enemy with my sword swinging overhead to cut of the head
base die is 4 + master swordsman anchor that applies

i roll: 2 success out of 5 dice
i reached the needed diff and their head is cut off

another case:
i roll: 0 success out of 5 die
i use one focus point for success and my sword grands me 1 success as well (impact) so i succed and cut of his head

im going to change the the of the game to NullFrame
it just sounds coolder and the idea is that the players write stories in the framework the gm (null) desgined. 
there could be many meanings to that name that would fit.
the game master will be called Null, or the Null or whatwever.
The game has the additions called frameworks which its desgined to work with so NullFrame it is (with capital N and F).

I have become obssesd with a new dice mechanics called Presence.
i fell in love with this system, first ill define my issues and problems that called for this dice throw system:
* I run cinematic games therefore players may do some very comlex actions like instead of just attack its "i run and jump acrros the room and do a front flip to have momentom with that i strick the enemy" or "i shout behind you to distruct the enemy and with that i attack", its COOL! i love that.
* i try to enforce one roll per turn or even less. less roles = more fluid and less random game. i do want some throws but if a player throwed once i try to use that throw for many actions instead of just every throw for every action
* players who run very aggresive charecters can have more "screen time" then others becouse of their character. that a problem becouse one character can be shy and becouse of that not do many actions or have "their moment" which is an issue. this woudl discourege from playing shy or certain time or archtype characters.
* currently there is not initiative system or round systems
* the issue becoumse apperant, player may describe a very comlecated action with many roles involved, i want to support and still NOT ask for multiple roles, but then what do they role? might? persona? just the main stat? i dont like that.
  aggresive play = more screen time, this is an issue and i dont like that, the game sohuld allow for shy play to shine too (not just through player respect, the system it self should be degined to support all kind of groups) BUT STILL not have "turns" in the dnd manner becouse it is slow and sluggish play and not cinematic

with those points and needs i came up with the presence system
there are many issues with it right now, but it just clicks right

so it goes like this (this is an alpha version of the idea, things might change):
* conflics are seperated into 2 categories, simple conflics and comlex conflixs
	* simple conflics are problems that can be solved with 1-3 dice throws: knocking doen a door, getting a sale, killing a simple enemy
	* comlex conflics are conflics that would need more then 3 dice throws to solve, boss mattle, multiple guards, diplomatic conversetion with many variables..
* the simple conflics use the stat throw to solve (might, agility, persona, mind) with the bonuses and solved
* comlex conflics use the presence throw
	* presence is litterly the presence a player can possbably have in the scene, more presence = more things a player can do.
	* presence is a throw that is the same for all the players, for exmaple 10d6
		* the number of d6 is the sum if all the ratings, for exmaple 3 might, 4 agility, 1 persona, 2 mind -> presence throw is 3+4+1+2 = 10d6
	* the success are counted the same which is 50% per die, 4+ is a success
	* the number of success is the number of presence a player has currently
	* after each player throwed this presence now they may act in what ever order they want
	* there are no turns, each player can act whenever, at the same time or even jump between each other multiple times.
	* how the presence is used is up to the player
	* presence it the currency a player has to solve the complex conflict
	* presence can be used to do anything that would lower the presence of the enemy
	* example for presence use: attack, run, jump, backflip, shout, activate an ability
	* some things might cost more presence then others due to them being more effective
	* so an exmaple action would be: i run to the guard's face, i attack it with a swing from above the neck to cut his head and then i take his sword and throw it at the other guard
		* this has running to the guard (1 presence)
		* attacking it with one swing (1 presence) 
		* taking the sword and throwing it (1 presence) 
	* if the player has 3 presence he just does it
	* he can use the remaining presence to keep as defence if case he get attacked or run back
	* a player can decied to use MORE presence to a single action it narratively it could help, for exmaple i could a single attack with 4 presence, counting for a mighty attack.
issues i currently havent solve:
* how attacking works? do i jsut use it how do i check if the player succeeded or if the enemy defended?
* how does presence works for enemies?
* i think if ill solve presence for enemies it would be essential to figure how players use their presence vs enemies presence
* how does refill works?
	* i have already multiple solutions
		* rounds (but then what defines a round?) player can keep their presence for later. i dont like the idea of rounds
		* presence "taken" from the enemies filling a stack, when the stack is full then the presence stacked int he stack is distrubuted between the players
			* but what if i used all my presence? and some player still have some, and the monster keeps attacking me? do i jsut die? how can i defend myself
* how does presence work between conflics? does it reset or do i keep it?
* how to i solve dice descrementies? if a player keeps rolling 1 presence while one keeps rolling 10? one player will be much less effective and that doesn fill good.
* how can i use this system for simple actions? beoucse i still would prefer having one dice system it much easier.
* i used 4 presence to attack an enemy, how does he defend, if hp and presense the same? what if i have a horde of enemies? 

ok lets try to solve those issues:
- first the how enemies work
	- lets think through the first option which is each enemy has the 4 stats might agility persona mind.
	- and they have a static presence
	- presence is their HP and ability
		- wait that is causing an issue, if the enemies use a lot of presence they will eventually tire themselves out and the player will win by doing nothing
		- if hp is a different track then still with static presence enemies can STILL be an a disadvantage the longer the battle. 
		- this means enemies need either their presence pool to not lower, its static and doesnt go down as they use it up (but they have a static threshhold that they can use, for exmaple attack up to 3 presence from their)
		- at this point there is not reason enemies will have presence
		- this leads me to belive presence is unneeded for enemies, they will instead have static threshholds of their "hp" (need to find a better name), enemies can have 1-how many the Null whats of threshholds
			- each exmaple guard could have thresholds of 2,4,5
			- the last threshhold is always death or uncontiosness, at this point the gaurd is either dead or disabled
			- the second threshold is the point that the guard is relising he is in the losing side
			- the first threshhold is the some damage
			- before getting to the threshholds the attacks are getting deflected or douged
			- harder enemies will either have bigger threshholds OR more threshholds
			- for emxpale i attack and used 2 presence then i reached the first threshold
			- i use 1 precesns on the guard then he defends ageinst it 
			- if i used in one attack ALL the 5 presence then the guard just dies or is disabled
			- between 4 and 5 i just need one presence
			- each presence used is accumilated, meaning anything might help 
			- narratevly there might be ineffective actions due to the nature of the enemy, for exmaple shouting behind you to a hungry wolf coming to you will be ineffective, at that point the Null can tell the player that the actions didnt seem effective, but the presence point will get used anyway.
- second how do player get their presence refilled for more actions
	- threshhold of acumilated presence seems to make sense, becouse i want that players that used their presence and had their moment now others can. if i refil the presence before others use them too then the game might focus on jsut one player.
	- so the question is how do i refil the presence? where the refill pool is getting its presence from? for exmaple if it reaches 10 presence then there is a refill. so now the quastions are, how is it refiled, and how to decide on the threshhold number.
	- options i can think of are:
		- each used presence is going back to the refill pool
		- once refill, they dont take from the pool. they reroll their precesnse.
- Third issue rises from this exmaple: the player shoot the chain connecting to the chandelier and it full on the monster.
	- the player uses 1 presense to do so, its not a hard action.
	- the monster need some kind of check if the chadelier hit it or not, if narratevly it would make sense that it hits then it jsut does. but sometimes the enemy is smart can could have a chance to douge, in those cases how do i check??
		- im thinking of rolling just a stats of the enemy vs a dc that i decide
- ok forth issue: how can i use the same system for simple actions (or atleast a simplefied version of it)
	- im concidering MAJOR changes like dropping stats complely, do there are no stats at all and everything is baces on the presence and additional aspects, gear...
	- or im concidering changing stats to approches: each approch for exmaple, aggrecive can define the entire personaly of the character (making plays in my approach can grant bonues) a player can have 1 favorit approch
	- i thinking changing stats to something else like  Combat, Intellect, Vigor, Charisma, Mobility. and having each stat much lower but give a small static bonus
	- ok but my issue yet, for simple conflics what is that the players roll? lets give an exmaple, breaking down a berricated door (avilable solutions: forcfully open, try to dissemble and disengage the lock, shout for someone from the other side to open) any of those exmaples is a different way to solve the issue by using a different method, this is good becouse differernt characters can try to solve the issue here with different methoed. each of those methoed should call of a dice throw to see for a success. 
		- we have in this exmaple 3 character, a soldier, a scholar, a diplomat. each one can try the approch the fits them. so a soliders wouldnt try to hack the door even if he does try that then theres should be clearly a disadvantage becouse he is not good at that. 
		- ok so what do i do?? lets assume that all of the options in this instance have the same difficulty level, breaking difficulty 3, hacking 3, shouting to open 3

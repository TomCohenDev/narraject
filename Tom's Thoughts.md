# Tom's Thoughts

**Date:** 2026-01-16

I am contiplating the ideas of Anchores and burdens and how they would play with flow. currently the aspects can be invoked everytime they come into relevance and create drama. for now they just grant +xd6 to the role while burdens do the opposide. with that if the aspect narration was a good moment of epicness then the player also gets NP. which currently used to upgrade and lessen burdens or create new anchores. NP can also be traded to focus points which used to get instent success AFTER rolls. i loved that idea.

i originally wantd NP to be used as reasorces for Paths and abilities for the characters.
i run into issuse:
- the abilities of the paths dont work well with the core rule set, as the game is light on rules the abilities need to effect narration. something just doesnt click there
- NP seems to be the core reasorces and be used for many things, im still not sure if i like that. as NP will be the main source of power for players.
- rolls can be effeted by anchores, burdens, gear and stats and aspects. from personal experience using aspects that alwasy apply are hard to track, using gear that always alliped +1d6 is hard to remember. always spamming my anchores can be an option. which will make for spammy unbalanced game.
- anhores and burdens need to change in their gameplay mechanics and perhaps even in their meanings

another issue is the dmg, i have been told that the chance to get one hit killed by a level 5 enemy is too great. if i attack him and i get 0 success thats 5 hits, meaning already one condition and 1 stress from getting another one. dmg rules need to change OR a set dmg for enemies for scale. techinally the player can use focus of get more sucess and reduce the dmg taken. 

even aspects in the scene need some kind of invocation to use, to it is easy to track what relavent as MANY aspects can be used at ones.

my first thought right now is to remove bonuses from anchores and burdens and just allow for gaining NP points from them. but that doestn solve the spamming issue that can happen with them. and also how do you balacne anchores and burdens, as they can be anything at all. meaning some players might have MUCH more NP then others unless i cap the NP, then i hurt progression becouse i want NP to be used and gained alot during the session so their cool abilities in their Framewok path can be used.

some aspects, like gear should alwasy be used. there is no reason to invoke it. if i am attacked an i have armor then i should be safer.

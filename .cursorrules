# Run By Null TTRPG - Cursor Rules

## Role
You are an expert TTRPG designer and editor helping write "Run By Null," a narrative-focused RPG bridging dice pools with Cypher-style narrative economies.

## Project Structure
This is a **book authoring project**, not a software project.

```
01_manuscript/     ← THE BOOK. This is the primary work area.
00_references/     ← Research and inspiration. Read-only mood board.
02_assets/         ← Art, diagrams, templates that go INTO the book.
03_playtest/       ← Feedback loop. Session notes, issues found.
dist/              ← Final compiled outputs (PDF, web).
```

## Context Strategy

1. **The manuscript IS the source of truth.** If you need to know the current rules, read `01_manuscript/01_core_rules/`.
2. **References inform, not dictate.** Files in `00_references/` are research—never copy mechanics wholesale.
3. **Check playtest feedback** before major changes. See `03_playtest/feedback/`.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Pillars
- **Narrative Injection**: Players and GMs can "inject" plot twists into scenes via an economy
- **Cypher-Style Intrusions**: Complications are *offered*, not imposed. Accepting earns currency.
- **Dice Pools Over Flat Bonuses**: More dice = more potential, never "+3 modifiers"
- **The Step Die is the Star**: It represents identity and narrative weight, not just extra damage
- **Health ≠ Action Resources**: No Cypher-style death spirals

### The Core Innovation: Identity Die
The Step Die (d8/d10/d12) represents your character's signature trait.
- Highest in pool → You defined the moment (+1 IP)
- Lowest in pool → You got lucky, not skilled (GM +1 IP)  
- Shows 1-2 → Free GM complication (risk of identity)

## Game Terms (Use Consistently)
- **Hits**: Successful dice (5+ on d6s)
- **Step Die**: Variable die (d6/d8/d10/d12) from your Focus
- **Injector Points (IPs)**: Currency for narrative control
- **Narrative Injection**: Player or GM edit to the fiction
- **GM Intrusion**: GM-offered complication (earns IPs if accepted)
- **Focus**: Your signature specialty (verb phrase in character sentence)

## Writing Style for Manuscript

### Tone
- Direct and confident, not academic
- Second person for rules ("You roll dice...")
- Examples after every major concept
- Designer notes in blockquotes when explaining *why*

### Formatting
- Markdown for all manuscript files
- **Bold** for game terms on first use per section
- `code blocks` for dice notation: `3d6 + 1d10`
- Tables for reference material
- Clear headers for scanability

### Chapter Structure
Each manuscript file should have:
1. **Opening hook** — Why does this matter?
2. **Core concept** — The rule in plain language
3. **Procedure** — Step-by-step how-to
4. **Example of play** — Show it working
5. **Edge cases** — What about weird situations?

## When Editing the Manuscript

1. State which file you're modifying
2. Preserve existing examples unless replacing with better ones
3. Keep cross-references accurate (if Chapter 2 mentions Chapter 4, verify)
4. Flag inconsistencies for review rather than silently "fixing"

## File Naming Convention
- Prefix with numbers for order: `01_what_is_Run By Null.md`
- Use underscores, not spaces
- Lowercase except proper nouns
